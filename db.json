It uses long, smooth strokes to help improve circulation and flexibility. Deep tissue massage is a more intense type of massage that targets the deeper layers of muscle tissue.

This type of massage can be used to promote relaxation, reduce stress, and improve mood.\n\nAny of these types of massages can be a great addition to a wellness workout routine.

This can help improve range of motion and make it easier to complete a variety of exercises. Additionally, massage can help reduce muscle soreness and fatigue, which can make it easier to recover after a workout.
