#  Alderney Gambling Board Grants First Casino Licence - Rivers Casino to Open in February

The Alderney Gambling Board (AGB) has announced that it has granted the first casino licence since the amended Casino Ordinance was passed in May last year. The licence has been granted to Rivers Casino which is set to open in February next year.

The AGB has been working closely with the casino licensee and its architects to ensure that all aspects of the new casino are compliant with the amended Casino Ordinance including the new player protection measures.

Rivers Casino is a £25 million investment and will create 80 jobs when it opens next year. It will be located on the site of the former La Panetière hotel, which closed its doors in 2009. The casino will have 15 gaming tables and 150 slot machines as well as a restaurant, bar and lounge.

Commenting on the granting of the first casino licence, Deputy Chief Executive Officer of the AGB, Peter Green said: “We are very pleased to have granted our first casino licence since the amended Casino Ordinance came into effect. This demonstrates our commitment to ensuring that Alderney remains a world leading jurisdiction for online gaming and provides a new leisure amenity for our residents and visitors alike.”

#  First Casino Licence Issued in Alderney - Rivers Casino to Open Soon

The first casino licence has been issued in Alderney, with the Rivers Casino set to open soon.

Alderney is located in the English Channel and is a self-governing dependency of the British Crown. The island has long been a popular gambling destination, and with the issuing of the first casino licence, that is only expected to increase.

The Rivers Casino will be located in St. Peter Port and will offer a range of gaming options, including blackjack, roulette, and poker. There will also be a range of slots machines on offer.

The casino is expected to be a major tourist attraction for the island, with officials anticipating that it will bring in around £10 million per year in gaming revenue. This should be a major boost to the local economy, which has been struggling in recent years.

Speaking about the new casino, Deputy Chief Minister Kevin Stewart said: "The granting of this licence is great news for Alderney and its residents. The Rivers Casino will create jobs and bring much needed investment to the island."

He added: "We are confident that it will be a huge success and will attract tourists from all over."

The opening of the Rivers Casino marks an exciting new chapter for Alderney's gambling industry. With its superb location and world-class facilities, it is sure to attract players from all over.

The new casino will include a 150-room hotel, a spa, several restaurants, and a gaming floor with over 100 slots and tables. It will be situated on the seafront in St Peter Port and is expected to attract tourists from around the world.
