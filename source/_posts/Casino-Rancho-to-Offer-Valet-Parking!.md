#  When to Split in Blackjack at Casino Rancho

There are a number of conflicting rules out there about when to split in blackjack at Casino Rancho. You may have heard that you should always split a pair of aces, for example. But is that really the best strategy?

To answer this question, it’s important to understand the basic rules of blackjack. In blackjack, the aim is to beat the dealer by getting closer to 21 than he does, without going over. If you get 21 immediately (a “blackjack”), you automatically win!

In general, you should always split a pair of 8s, 10s, and aces. For other pairs, it depends on the composition of the dealer’s hand. For example, if the dealer has an ace as his upcard, you should not split any pairs except 2s.

The reason for this is that when the dealer has an ace as his upcard, he has a good chance of getting close to 21 (the ace can be counted as 1 or 11). Therefore, splitting your low cards (2s through 7s) would be a bad move, because the odds are high that both cards will get busted.

If the dealer has a 2 as his upcard, on the other hand, you should always split a pair of 2s. This is because when the dealer has a low card as his upcard, he is more likely to bust. So by splitting your 2s, you have better odds of winning one hand and losing another instead of both hands getting busted.
