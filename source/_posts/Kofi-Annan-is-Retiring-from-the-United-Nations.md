#  Kofi Annan is Retiring from the United Nations

Kofi Annan, the seventh secretary-general of the United Nations, is retiring from his post. Annan took over as the head of the UN in 1997 and has been a major advocate for promoting human rights around the world. He has also been a central figure in many global crises, such as the war in Iraq and the refugee crisis in Europe.

Annan has decided to step down in order to focus on peacebuilding and conflict resolution. In a statement released by his office, he said: "I feel privileged to have served as Secretary-General of the United Nations and deeply grateful to all those who have supported me and my team over the past twelve years."

Ban Ki-moon, the current UN secretary-general, praised Annan for his many accomplishments during his tenure. "Kofi Annan is one of the great global leaders of our time," Ban said. "He has worked tirelessly to promote peace, democracy, human rights and prosperity around the world."

Annan's legacy will be remembered for his work in promoting human rights and resolving conflict around the world. He is also well known for his efforts to make the UN more efficient and effective. In a statement announcing his retirement, Annan said: "The UN must be brought closer to people and allowed to act on their behalf more rapidly and effectively."

#  Kofi Annan named Special Envoy to help Syrian Peace Talks

Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary-general, has been appointed as a special envoy to help revive Syrian peace talks.

The UN said Mr Annan will work with the group of nations known as the "Friends of Syria" to implement a peace plan that calls for a transitional government to lead Syria to democratic elections.

The move came as Syrian forces bombarded Homs for a 20th day and rebels killed 28 troops in two attacks on army checkpoints in Idlib province.

Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, said he was grateful to Mr Annan for taking on the job.

"I am deeply troubled by the grave situation in Syria and the tragic loss of life," he said. "Kofi has great experience and expertise in mediating complex disputes and I am sure he will bring all his wisdom and insight to this critical task."




Annan accepted the job despite his reservations about international intervention. In an interview with CNN, he said: "I am not a superhero, and I can't do it alone." 

He also said that there was no military solution to the conflict and called for urgent dialogue between all sides. 
"It is incumbent on those with influence to help nudge the parties towards constructive dialogue and avoid further bloodshed," he said.

#  Kofi Annan urges more support for Syrians

United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres (seen above with Kofi Annan) appointed a new envoy to Syria on Thursday, August 24, amid warnings of potential a new humanitarian disaster in the rebel-held Idlib province.

Kofi Annan, who served as the UN's special envoy to Syria from February 2012 until he resigned in August 2012, has urged the international community to provide more support to Syrians. The Syrian conflict has killed more than 330,000 people and displaced millions since it began in 2011.

"The fall of Aleppo was a turning point in the war," said Annan. "There must be consequences for those who continue to flout international law."

The UN Security Council is scheduled to hold a meeting on Syria on Friday, August 25.

#  Remembering Kofi Annan, former U.N. secretary-general

Kofi Annan, the former U.N. secretary-general, passed away on Saturday at the age of 80. He was a Ghanaian diplomat who dedicated his life to public service, and will be remembered for his work in advancing human rights and peace.

Annan was born in Kumasi, Ghana, in 1938. After graduating from college, he began his career as a diplomat for the West African nations of Ivory Coast and Ghana. In 1971, he was appointed as deputy head of mission at the U.N. headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. He subsequently served as Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, and then as acting Secretary-General when Boutros Boutros-Ghali resigned in 1996.

Annan was elected Secretary-General later that year, becoming the first black African to hold the position. During his tenure, he worked to expand the role of the U.N. in response to global crises such as the September 11th terrorist attacks and the Iraq War. He also made strides in promoting human rights and fighting poverty worldwide. In 2001, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize “for efforts to revitalize the organization and to enable it to better respond to 21st century challenges.”

After stepping down as Secretary-General in 2006, Annan continued to serve as a U.N. special envoy for humanitarian issues and peacekeeping operations. He also founded The Kofi Annan Foundation, which works to promote good governance and sustainable development around the world.

In a statement following Annan’s death, U.N. General Assembly President Miroslav Lajčák said “Kofi Annan was someone who always looked out for others before himself […] He was humanity’s best example, its biggest champion and its most articulate spokesman […] We have lost a great man; we have lost an irreplaceable leader […] But even more importantly than what we have lost is what Kofi leaves behind – an example of how one can live one’s life with purpose."

Kofi Annan will be remembered as one of the most accomplished diplomats of our time, and his work in promoting peace and human rights will continue to impact people all over the world
