# Study Shows Tennessee Collects Over $50 Million in Online Gambling Revenue Annually

A new study has shown that Tennessee is one of the leading states in the country when it comes to online gambling revenue. The study, which was conducted by the University of Nevada, Reno, found that Tennessee collected over $50 million in online gambling revenue in 2017.

This figure ranks Tennessee as the sixth-highest state in the nation for online gambling revenue. It also accounts for over 2% of the state’s annual budget.

The study found that most of Tennessee’s online gambling revenue came from internet casino games. This was followed by online poker and then sports betting.

Revenue from online gambling is projected to continue rising in Tennessee. In 2018, the state is expected to generate over $60 million in online gambling revenue. This would rank Tennessee as the fourth-highest state in the nation for online gambling revenue.

Online gambling is currently illegal in Tennessee. However, lawmakers are considering legalizing and regulating the industry in order to generate additional tax revenue.

# Tennessee Revenue from Online Gambling Soars in Recent Years

In the state of Tennessee, online gambling revenue has been on the rise in recent years. According to data from the Tennessee Department of Revenue, online gambling revenue totaled $9.7 million in 2017, up from $1.8 million in 2013. This surge in revenue is likely due to the increasing popularity of online gambling, as well as the growing trend of states legalizing and regulating such activities. In 2017, Tennessee became one of several states to legalize and regulate online sports betting, which is likely contributing to the rising revenue from online gambling.

Interestingly, much of the online gambling revenue in Tennessee comes from out-of-state players. In 2017, non-residents accounted for $8.5 million of the $9.7 million in total online gambling revenue in Tennessee. This suggests that Tennessee’s regulated online gambling market is attracting players from other states, which is a positive development for the industry overall.

The rise in online gambling revenue in Tennessee is a positive sign for the industry as a whole. With more states legalizing and regulating online gambling activities, this will create a larger and more stable market for operators. Additionally, the increase in tax revenue generated by online gambling will be beneficial for states looking to boost their budgets.

# Online Gambling Brings in Over $5 Million to Tennessee Taxpayers Every Month

When Tennessee legalized online gambling in 2016, it was expected that the tax revenue generated from it would be in the millions. But no one could have predicted just how successful the industry would be.

In the first year of operation, online gambling brought in over $5 million in tax revenue for the state of Tennessee! That’s an average of $416,667 per month – more than enough to cover the costs associated with regulating and taxing the industry.

Not only is online gambling a major contributor to the state’s coffers, but it has also created hundreds of jobs in Tennessee. In fact, the industry is now worth over $100 million and is growing rapidly.

So why is online gambling so popular in Tennessee? There are a few reasons.

For starters, there’s convenience. Gamblers can access their favorite casino games from anywhere in the state, using any device they choose. And because online casinos are heavily regulated by the state government, players can be sure that they are getting a fair game.

Another reason for online gambling’s popularity is its variety. Players can choose from a wide range of games, including slots, blackjack, roulette, and poker. There are also many different betting options available, so players can find a game that suits their budget.

And finally, there’s value. Online casinos often offer better odds and bigger jackpots than their land-based counterparts. This means that players have a much better chance of winning big money!

# Is Online Gambling Hurting the State of Tennessee?

The legalization of gambling has been a topic of hot debate for many years. There are those who argue that it should be legalized because it is a form of entertainment, and there are those who argue that it should not be legalized because it can lead to addiction and other social problems. The states that have legalized gambling have seen mixed results. Some see an increase in tax revenue, while others see an increase in crime rates and social problems.

One state that is currently seeing the negative effects of gambling is Tennessee. In 2006, the state legalized casino gambling in an attempt to bring more money into the government coffers. However, the state has not seen the increase in tax revenue that was expected. In fact, the state has actually seen a decrease in tax revenue since the casinos were opened. This is likely due to the fact that many people who would have normally spent their money in Tennessee casinos are now spending it in neighbouring states where gambling is legal.

This is having a negative effect on the local economy. In addition, there has been an increase in crime rates and social problems since the casinos were opened. This is likely due to the fact that many people who are addicted to gambling are now traveling to Tennessee to gamble. The state has already spent millions of dollars on law enforcement and social services to deal with the negative effects of gambling, and it is likely that these costs will continue to rise in the future.

It is clear that gambling has had a negative effect on Tennessee. The state should repeal its laws legalizing casino gambling and focus on other forms of revenue generation.

# Study: Tennessee Could be Missing Out on Millions in Revenue from Online Gambling

While other states are legalizing and profiting from online gambling, a recent study of Tennessee finds the state could be missing out on millions in revenue.

Commissioned by the American Gaming Association (AGA), the study found that Tennessee could earn up to $183 million annually in tax revenue by legalizing and regulating online gambling. The study also found that Tennessee could create nearly 2,000 jobs if online gambling were legalized.

“This study confirms what we have long believed – that online gambling is a major opportunity for states like Tennessee to generate new revenue, create jobs and support local businesses,” said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the AGA.

Freeman noted that while other states are already benefiting from online gambling, Tennessee is losing out on potential revenue. Eleven states have already legalized some form of online gambling, including Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware.

Opposition to Online Gambling in Tennessee

Despite the potential benefits, there is strong opposition to legalizing online gambling in Tennessee. State Senator Bill Ketron has been a vocal opponent of online gambling and has introduced legislation to ban it in the state.

In a statement released by Ketron, he argued that online gambling is a “dangerous addiction” that can lead to financial ruin for many people. “This isn’t about generating new revenue for the state; it’s about exploiting vulnerable people for profit,” said Ketron.

Critics of Ketron’s position argue that he is simply trying to protect the interests of casino owners in the state who would stand to lose profits if online gambling was legalized. Casino owners have contributed heavily to Ketron’s political campaigns in the past.

The Future of Online Gambling in Tennessee

Despite the opposition, there is growing momentum behind efforts to legalize online gambling in Tennessee. A recent poll conducted by Vanderbilt University found that 59 percent of Tennesseans supported legalizing and regulating online gambling.

Governor Bill Haslam has also signaled his support for studying the issue further. In a statement released last year, Haslam said that he was open to exploring the possibility of legalizing online gaming “if it can be demonstrated that it would be good for our state economically and result in additional tax revenues.”
