#  Casino Borussia Mönchengladbach: Get Your Chips For Free!

In the western city of Mönchengladbach, football reigns supreme. The local Bundesliga club, Borussia Mönchengladbach, has been a mainstay in the top division of German football for over four decades. But the club’s history goes back even further than that.

Borussia was founded in 1900, and played its first game just two years later. The club was initially a member of the Verband Westdeutscher Spielkarten-Vereine (the Association of Western German Card Clubs), which is where it got its name – Borussia is the Latin term for Prussia.

In its early years, Borussia was a successful side, winning the Westphalian championship in 1911 and 1913. However, it would be another four decades until the team achieved any real success.

In 1970, Borussia Mönchengladbach reached the final of the European Cup Winners’ Cup, where they faced English side Chelsea. The match went to a replay after finishing level at 2-2 after extra time. However, Chelsea would eventually prevail, winning 3-2 to lift the trophy.

The 1970s were a golden era for Borussia Mönchengladbach. The team would go on to win five Bundesliga titles, as well as two DFB-Pokals (German Cup) and one UEFA Cup. In total, they reached seven major European finals – more than any other club at that time.

Borussia’s form has waxed and waned since those heady days in the 1970s, but they remain one of Germany’s most popular clubs. Each weekend, tens of thousands of fans make their way to the Borussia Park stadium to cheer on their heroes. And now there’s an added incentive to do so – free chips!
