#  Genting Casino Roth Plans Grand Opening

Genting Casino Roth is planning a grand opening celebration for the week of September 10. The new casino, located on the outskirts of Roth, is a major investment for the small town and is expected to create hundreds of jobs in the coming years.

The casino is built on the site of the former Roth Mall, which closed in 2009. The mall was a major employer in the town, but its closure left many residents unemployed. Genting Casino Roth is expected to fill that void, creating 300 jobs in the process.

In addition to the jobs, the casino is also expected to generate millions of dollars in tax revenue for the town and state. This money will be used to fund important projects like infrastructure improvements and education initiatives.

Residents of Roth are excited about the opening of Genting Casino Roth. They believe that it will breathe new life into their community and help to make it a better place to live.
