#  Celtics beat Cavaliers in dramatic fashion to advance to Eastern Conference Finals

The Celtics were led by superstar guard Kyrie Irving, who played one of the best games of his career. Irving scored 26 points on 10-of-16 shooting, including the game-winning three pointer with 53 seconds remaining.

Boston will now face the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Sixers stunned the top-seeded Toronto Raptors in five games to reach the conference finals for the first time since 2001.

#  Golden State Warriors complete sweep of San Antonio Spurs

The Golden State Warriors completed a sweep of the San Antonio Spurs with a 119-113 victory in Game 4 of their Western Conference Finals on Monday.

The Warriors will now await the winner of the Houston Rockets and Oklahoma City Thunder series, which is currently tied at 2-2.

The win was not without controversy, as Spurs forward Kawhi Leonard left the game with an ankle injury midway through the third quarter. Leonard initially stayed in the game, but was later taken to the locker room and did not return.

Warriors guard Stephen Curry led all scorers with 33 points, while Kevin Durant added 32 points and 10 rebounds. Leonard finished with 26 points and 8 rebounds before leaving the game.

“It sucks to see him go out like that,” Durant said of Leonard. “He’s a great player, one of the best players in our league. It sucks to see him limping off the court like that.”

#  Pittsburgh Penguins win Stanley Cup in thrilling Game Seven

The Pittsburgh Penguins capped off an amazing season on Thursday night, winning their second consecutive Stanley Cup in thrilling fashion with a 2-1 victory over the Nashville Predators in Game Seven.

It was a back-and-forth game throughout, with the Penguins scoring first before the Predators tied it up in the third period. But Pittsburgh's Sidney Crosby proved to be the difference maker, scoring the game-winning goal with just over a minute remaining in regulation to send the Penguins faithful into delirium.

The victory gives goaltender Matt Murray - who was making his Stanley Cup debut - his second championship at just 22 years of age, cementing his place as one of the NHL's greatest young players. For Crosby, it caps off a comeback season after dealing with injuries and off-ice issues early on.

"This is what it's all about," said Crosby after the game. "You work all year long for moments like this."

Pittsburgh becomes only the second team in NHL history to win back-to-back titles, and owner Mario Lemieux becomes the first owner in any major North American sports league to win three championships.

#  Chris Paul leads Rockets over Jazz in decisive Game Seven

HOUSTON (AP) — Chris Paul had 27 points and 10 assists to help the Houston Rockets eliminate the Utah Jazz with a 105-92 victory in Game 7 of their Western Conference semifinal on Monday night.

The Rockets, who will face the Golden State Warriors in the conference finals, got a huge boost from Eric Gordon, who scored 24 points off the bench. Gordon hit five 3-pointers, including one that put Houston up 92-81 with less than five minutes left.

James Harden added 18 points for Houston.

Houston's big fourth quarter allowed Paul to avoid having to make a decision on his future. The star guard is a free agent this summer and was expected to weigh his options after the season. But now he can focus on getting the Rockets back to the NBA Finals for the first time since 1995.

Houston will have its hands full with Golden State, which is coming off a sweep of San Antonio in the other Western Conference semifinal.

Rudy Gobert led Utah with 22 points and 15 rebounds, and Ricky Rubio added 17 points and 11 assists.

#  Nashville Predators vs Anaheim Ducks: Who will come out on top?

The Nashville Predators and Anaheim Ducks will go head-to-head in the 2017 Western Conference Finals. The Ducks are coming into this matchup as the defending conference champions, but Nashville is not a team to be taken lightly. Let’s take a closer look at each of these teams and see who is likely to come out on top.

The Nashville Predators had an impressive run in the playoffs, knocking off the Chicago Blackhawks in six games and then taking down the St. Louis Blues in six games as well. They have been playing some of their best hockey of the season at just the right time and will be looking to continue their momentum against the Ducks. Pekka Rinne has been phenomenal in goal for Nashville, posting a save percentage of .947 in the playoffs. The defense has also been strong, led by Roman Josi and P.K. Subban. The Predators are a deep team that can score goals and play defense, which makes them a tough opponent for any team.

The Anaheim Ducks had a bit of a tougher road to the conference finals, needing seven games to get past both the Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers. However, they are coming into this matchup with all of their key players healthy and ready to go. Ryan Getzlaf, Corey Perry, Hampus Lindholm and Jakob Silfverberg all had an impact in the Ducks’ first round series against Calgary, with Getzlaf leading the team in scoring with 11 points (5 goals, 6 assists) in 7 games. The Ducks have also been getting strong goaltending from John Gibson, who is currently sporting a save percentage of .927 in the playoffs. Anaheim is no doubt a formidable opponent, but they will need to play their best hockey if they hope to upset Nashville.

So who will come out on top? It’s definitely going to be a close matchup, but I give the edge to the Nashville Predators. They have been playing great hockey lately and have more depth than Anaheim does. Rinne has also been outstanding between the pipes, which could be crucial in this series. I expect Nashville to win this series in six or seven games en route to making it to their first Stanley Cup Final appearance
