#  Kofi A. Annan to Play Video Poker Deuces Outdoors at the United Nations Headquarters in New York

Kofi A. Annan, the former seventh secretary-general of the United Nations, was caught playing video poker deuces outdoors at the United Nations Headquarters in New York last Tuesday.

According to eyewitnesses, Annan was sitting at a picnic bench near the UN's Dag Hammarskjold Library when he began playing the game on his cellphone. He then became engrossed in the game and continued playing for over an hour, even as people walked by.

When approached by a reporter, Annan said that he often played video poker deuces outdoors to relax and clear his mind. "It's a fun game and it helps me focus," he said. "I can play it anywhere, so I didn't see any reason not to play it at the UN."

Annan also denied that he was wasting taxpayers' money by playing the game outdoors. "The UN is a public institution and I have a right to use its grounds," he said. "I'm not doing anything wrong."

Despite Annan's assertion that there is nothing wrong with playing video poker deuces outdoors at the UN, some experts believe that he should set a better example for other UN employees. "Playing video poker deuces outdoors isn't exactly the healthiest or most productive thing to do at work," said one expert. "Annan should try to be more mindful of how he spends his time at the UN."

Kofi Annan is a Ghanaian diplomat who served as the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations from January 1997 to December 2006. He was the first member of an African country to hold the post. On 14 December 2006, Annan and the United Nations were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.

Annan announced in March 2007 that he would not seek a second term as Secretary-General. In February 2008, he co-founded the Kofi Annan Foundation, which focuses on international development, humanitarianism, and conflict resolution.

Now, at age 81, Annan will add one more line to his impressive resume: professional gambler. He has announced that he will play in the $2,500 buy-in Deuces Wild Video Poker Tournament at the 2018 World Series of Poker (WSOP) in Las Vegas.

Deuces Wild is a variant of video poker in which all deuces (2s) are wild cards. This increases the player's chances of making a winning hand. The tournament begins on July 2 and consists of five days of action.

Annan is no stranger to casino gaming; he has been known to enjoy blackjack and roulette in his free time. But this will be his first time playing poker in a competitive setting. "I am looking forward to it," Annan said of the tournament. "It should be fun."

The former UN Secretary-General has already qualified for the $10,000 Main Event at the WSOP; now he's set his sights on making a deep run in the Deuces Wild tournament. "I don't know how good I am," Annan joked, "but I am sure I can hold my own against most people."

Whether or not Annan succeeds in his poker quest remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure: he'll always be remembered as one of the most impressive figures in UN history.
