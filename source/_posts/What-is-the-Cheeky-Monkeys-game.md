The Cheeky Monkeys game is a popular children’s game that involves using a set of toy animals to mimic the sounds that the animals make. The object of the game is to be the first player to collect four animal cards of the same kind.

# How do you play?

To play, each player is given a set of toy animals. One player starts by saying, “This is the _____ (name of animal).

#  How do I play the Cheeky Monkeys game?

The Cheeky Monkeys game is a simple but challenging puzzle game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages. The aim of the game is to help the cheeky monkeys reach the exit by rearranging the blocks in the level.

The controls are simple - use your mouse to click and drag the blocks around. You can also use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the blocks around.

There are a number of different blocks in the game, each with its own special ability. Here's a brief overview of each block:

-Blue Blocks: These blocks can be pushed around by other blocks.

-Red Blocks: These blocks cannot be moved or pushed around.

-Green Blocks: These blocks can be moved and pushed around like blue blocks, but they also act as springs, bouncing other blocks off them when they come into contact.

-Yellow Blocks: These blocks are heavy and will fall down if there is no support beneath them. They can be used to weigh down other blocks or hold doors open.

There are also bonus items that you can collect in the game, such as coins and gems. The coins can be used to purchase hints, while the gems can be used to unlock new worlds.

To get started, select a world from the World Select screen. There are four different worlds to choose from, each with six levels. Once you have selected a world, you will need to complete all six levels in that world before progressing to the next one.

To complete a level, you must help all three of the cheeky monkeys reach the exit. You can do this by rearranging the blocks so that they create a path for the monkeys to follow. Some levels contain locked doors which can only be opened once all of the required blocks have been collected. If you run out of moves or time, you will lose and will have to start over from the beginning of the level.

Here are a few tips for getting started in the game:

-Don't forget that you can use arrow keys on your keyboard to move blocks around. This might come in handy if your mouse isn't working properly.
2-You can temporarily disable green springs by clicking on them twice - this might come in handy if you're trying to line up a block next to them. 3-If you're stuck on a level, try using some of the hints that are available for purchase with coins.
