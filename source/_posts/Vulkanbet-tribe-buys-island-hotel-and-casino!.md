#  What local American tribe owns island hotel and casino?

The Rincon Band of Luiseño Indians, also known as the Rincon Luiseno Nation, is a federally recognized Tribe with a reservation near Santa Barbara, California. The Tribe owns and operates the Rincon Resort & Casino, located on its reservation in southern California.

The Rincon Band of Luiseño Indians traces its ancestry back to the ancient Lake Cahuilla people, who lived in the area now known as southern California for thousands of years. After being forcibly removed from their lands by the US government in 1875, the Tribe eventually settled on a small reservation in the Santa Barbara County foothills.

In 2004, the Rincon Band of Luiseño Indians opened the Rincon Resort & Casino on its reservation. The casino features over 900 slot machines and table games, as well as a hotel and spa. The Tribe has also developed a variety of other economic enterprises, including a farm-to-table restaurant, wedding venue, and cultural center.

The Rincon Band of Luiseño Indians is one of just over two hundred federally recognized tribes in California. These tribes have unique legal status under federal law, which recognizes them as sovereign nations with rights to self-government and significant control over their own lands. In addition to owning and operating the Rincon Resort & Casino, the Rincon Band of Luiseño Indians exercises jurisdiction over all activities on its reservation land, including zoning and archeological resources management.
