Malta, October 3, PXG, the luxury golf equipment company, today announced the limited availability of its BlackJack Putters. The Super Limited Edition putters are now available in Malta through select PXG retailers.

The BlackJack Putters are a result of PXG’s ongoing partnership with two-time major champion and PXG disciple Brooks Koepka. The collaboration has yielded Tour-winning putters that have helped Koepka win three majors in the last two years.
