#  Dodgers Bettors Feasted in Early Wagering Action

The Los Angeles Dodgers were big favorites in their matchup against the Atlanta Braves on Wednesday, and that was reflected in the early betting action.

At sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com, the Dodgers opened as high as -280 favorites, with moneyline odds of -1,100. They would go on to win the game 5-2, but those who bet on Los Angeles early missed out on some hefty profits.

Had a bettor put down $100 on the Dodgers to win Wednesday, they would have only Profited $14.29. In fact, only two of LAD’s last ten games have resulted in a payout higher than $14.29 for a $100 bettor.

Conversely, while the Braves may have lost Wednesday night, they proved to be a viable betting option earlier in the day. Atlanta opened as low as +220 underdogs at some sportsbooks and +1,000 on the moneyline. This meant that a $100 wager on the Braves would have resulted in a Profit of $220.

Wednesday wasn’t an anomaly for Atlanta, who has gone 7-3 over their last ten games against the spread. With eight games remaining on their schedule, including matchups against both Washington and Miami—two top teams in the National League—the Braves could provide plenty more profitable betting opportunities before the season comes to a close.

#  Sharp Dodgers Bettors Enjoyed Early Success

The Dodgers had a great first half of the season, and sharp bettors who jumped on their odds early were well rewarded. Bettors who got down at +375 on the Dodgers to win the World Series found themselves up over 50% at the end of July.

While the Dodgers have come back down to earth in recent weeks, they are still one of the top teams in baseball and remain a favorite to win the World Series. At their current odds of +450, sharp bettors can still make a healthy profit by betting on them to win it all.

The Cubs are currently the favorites to win the World Series, with odds of +350, but the Dodgers are right behind them and offer much better value. If you believe that LA is going to win it all, now is the time to place your bets.

#  Dodgers Bettors Had Edge in Early Wagering Action

The Los Angeles Dodgers were the betting favorites going into their first game of the National League Championship Series against the Milwaukee Brewers, and that was evident in the early wagering action.

According to oddsmakers from online sportsbook Bovada, the Dodgers were sizable -165 favorites to win Tuesday’s matchup. The Brewers, on the other hand, were +145 underdogs.

That lopsided betting trend continued into Wednesday’s game. Los Angeles was once again favored by -165, while Milwaukee was +145 underdogs.

So far, those odds have held up as the Dodgers have taken a 2-0 lead in the series. They will look to close things out in Milwaukee on Friday with Zack Greinke on the mound. The Brewers will counter with Gio Gonzalez.

#  Dodgers Bettors Found Plenty of Value in Early Wagering

The Los Angeles Dodgers have been one of the most popular teams to wager on so far this season, and the early returns have been largely positive for those who backed them. Despite a bit of a slow start, the Dodgers are still in first place in the National League West and are +1100 to win the World Series, according to odds from MyBookie.ag.

For the most part, the Dodgers have performed well against the spread (ATS) this year. They are currently 27-23-1 ATS, which is good for third in their division. Bettors who backed them when they were underdogs (9-10 ATS) have fared relatively well, as LA has won six of those games.

As with any bet, there have been some losers along the way, but that is to be expected when wagering on a team with such high odds to win the championship. Overall, though, those who have wagered on the Dodgers have found plenty of value.

There are a few reasons for this. First and foremost, LA is a very good team and should be favored in most games they play. Additionally, they play in a weak division and should easily make the playoffs. Finally, their odds to win the World Series are much higher than most other teams, so there is great potential for profit if they do end up winning it all.

It’s still too early in the season to make any definitive statements about how things will play out, but those who continue to back the Dodgers can be confident that they will at least provide some good value going forward.

#  Sharp Dodgers Bettors Came Out on Top in Early Wagering

The Los Angeles Dodgers started the season red hot and reached a new high on Tuesday night with a 5-1 victory over the rival San Francisco Giants. L.A. began the week as +500 underdogs at Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook, but even sharp bettors were on them early, taking the Dodgers down to +400 within 36 hours of opening. Bettors who sided with Dodgers early in the betting enjoyed a nice return on investment on Tuesday night and likely could have cashed even bigger had they waited until late in the week when L.A.’s odds dipped to as low as +325.

The Dodgers are now 18-9 overall and sit atop the NL West standings, just 2.5 games ahead of the defending World Series champion Giants. Clayton Kershaw continued his sensational start to the season on Tuesday night, striking out nine while allowing just one run in eight innings of work. The reigning Cy Young Award winner lowered his ERA to 1.73 and is off to one of the best starts in recent memory.

Even though Dodgers odds have consistently been lower than those of their opponents this season, there is still value to be found when betting on them, especially at home where they are 9-4 on the year. With Kershaw and other aces like Zack Greinke leading the way, L.A. is primed for another successful campaign and should be able to continue winning games against some of baseball’s best teams.
