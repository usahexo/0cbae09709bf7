        <h1 id="When-is-the-LA-Clippers’-next-game"><a href="#When-is-the-LA-Clippers’-next-game" class="headerlink" title="When is the LA Clippers’ next game?"></a>When is the LA Clippers’ next game?</h1><p>The LA Clippers next game is on December 13th at 7:30pm against the Memphis Grizzlies.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-LA-Clippers’-odds-to-win-the-NBA-Finals"><a href="#What-are-the-LA-Clippers’-odds-to-win-the-NBA-Finals" class="headerlink" title="What are the LA Clippers’ odds to win the NBA Finals?"></a>What are the LA Clippers’ odds to win the NBA Finals?</h1><p>The LA Clippers have made it to the playoffs for the past six seasons and are looking to make it to the NBA Finals for the first time in franchise history. The Clippers have had some success in the playoffs, but have yet to make it to the Finals. Injuries have played a role in their playoff failures, but this year’s team seems to be injury-free and poised for a deep playoff run. The Golden State Warriors are the clear favorites to win the NBA Finals, but the Clippers have a chance if they can stay healthy and play their best basketball.</p>
<p>The Clippers finished the regular season with a record of 48-34, which was good enough for third place in the Western Conference. They were able to secure home court advantage in the first round of the playoffs by virtue of winning more games than any other team that didn’t earn a first round bye. The first round matchup against the Utah Jazz should be fairly easy for the Clippers, as they are a better team on paper. If they can make it through that series, they would likely face off against either the Nuggets or Blazers in round two. Both of those teams would provide a much tougher test for LA, but they are capable of beating either one.</p>
<p>In order to win the NBA Finals, the Clippers will need to get past both Golden State and either Milwaukee or Toronto. It’s certainly possible that they could beat Milwaukee or Toronto and make it to the Finals, but they would be underdogs against Golden State. The Warriors are once again favourites to win it all this season, so anything can happen over seven games. If everything falls into place for LA and they manage to upset Golden State (or another team), they could very well be crowned NBA Champions this year.</p>
<h1 id="Who-is-the-LA-Clippers’-head-coach"><a href="#Who-is-the-LA-Clippers’-head-coach" class="headerlink" title="Who is the LA Clippers’ head coach?"></a>Who is the LA Clippers’ head coach?</h1><p>The LA Clippers’ head coach is Doc Rivers.</p>
<p>Rivers, 54, was born in Minneapolis and raised in Foxboro, Massachusetts. He starred as a point guard at Marquette University before playing in the NBA for nine seasons. After retiring as a player, he became a broadcaster and senior vice president for basketball operations for the Orlando Magic.</p>
<h1 id="How-much-do-LA-Clippers-tickets-cost"><a href="#How-much-do-LA-Clippers-tickets-cost" class="headerlink" title="How much do LA Clippers tickets cost?"></a>How much do LA Clippers tickets cost?</h1><p>The average price for LA Clippers tickets is currently $151, with the cheapest seats costing $27 and the most expensive going for $1,625.</p>
<p>The Clippers have had a resurgence in popularity in recent years, thanks in part to their exciting brand of basketball and high-profile players like Chris Paul and Blake Griffin. As a result, the demand for tickets has increased, with prices soaring on the secondary market.</p>
<p>The team is currently in the midst of a playoff run, so ticket prices are expected to continue rising as we get closer to the playoffs. If you’re looking to catch a game at Staples Center, it’s best to buy your tickets sooner rather than later.</p>
<h1 id="Who-are-the-LA-Clippers’-players"><a href="#Who-are-the-LA-Clippers’-players" class="headerlink" title="Who are the LA Clippers’ players?"></a>Who are the LA Clippers’ players?</h1><p>The LA Clippers are a professional basketball team based in Los Angeles, California. The team is a member of the Pacific Division of the Western Conference in the National Basketball Association (NBA). The Clippers were founded in 1970 as the Buffalo Braves, but relocated to San Diego in 1978 and became the San Diego Clippers. In 1984, they moved to Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The Clippers have had limited success in their history, but have won five division titles (1991, 1992, 1993, 2006, 2007) and one conference championship (2012). They have featured many star players over the years, including Bob McAdoo, Randy Smith, Keith Erickson, Terry Cummings, Danny Manning, Elton Brand, Chris Kaman, Blake Griffin and DeAndre Jordan.</p>
<p>Currently, the Clippers’ roster is made up of: DeAndre Jordan (center), Blake Griffin (power forward), Chris Paul (point guard), J.J. Redick (shooting guard), Jamal Crawford (point guard/shooting guard), Austin Rivers (point guard), Matt Barnes (small forward), Luc Mbah a Moute (power forward), Wes Johnson (small forward) and Marreese Speights (center).</p>
