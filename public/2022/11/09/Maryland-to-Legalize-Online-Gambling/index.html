        <h1 id="Maryland-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Maryland-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Maryland to Legalize Online Gambling"></a>Maryland to Legalize Online Gambling</h1><p>The state of Maryland is in the process of legalizing online gambling, with a bill that was recently introduced in the Senate. The legislation would allow both casino and lottery games to be offered online, with the hope of boosting revenue for the state.</p>
<p>Maryland is not the only state looking into legalizing online gambling - several others have introduced or are considering bills, including Indiana, Louisiana and Pennsylvania. This is in response to the growing popularity of online gaming, as well as increasing pressure from casino interests who see this as a potential new market.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling argue that it can be addictive and lead to financial problems for players. They also point to cases where gamblers have stolen money from friends or family in order to feed their addiction.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalization argue that these risks already exist with traditional gambling, and that properly regulating online gaming can help minimize them. They also say that it can be a valuable source of revenue for states, which are struggling with budget deficits.</p>
<p>So far, there does not appear to be much public opposition to Maryland’s proposal, and it is likely to pass given the current political climate. If it does, it will join a handful of states that offer legalized online gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Authorizes-First-Online-Casino"><a href="#Delaware-Authorizes-First-Online-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Authorizes First Online Casino"></a>Delaware Authorizes First Online Casino</h1><p>The state of Delaware has authorized the first online casino in the country. The new casino will be an extension of the three brick-and-mortar casinos that are already operating in the state. The new online casino is expected to be up and running in early 2013.</p>
<p>Delaware is one of only three states in the country that currently allows gambling. In addition to the new online casino, Delaware also offers betting on horse races and lottery games.</p>
<p>The online casino will be operated by Scientific Games Corporation, which already operates the state’s three brick-and-mortar casinos. The company was awarded a 20-year contract to operate the new casino.</p>
<p>The new casino will offer a variety of games, including slots, blackjack, and roulette. It will also offer a number of different betting options, including single bets, multi-game bets, and progressive jackpots.</p>
<p>Delaware officials believe that the new casino will be a major boon to the state’s economy. Chris Grundler, director of marketing for the Delaware Lottery, said that the online casino “will create jobs and generate revenue for Delaware through licensing fees and taxes.”</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Authorizes-Second-Online-Casino"><a href="#Nevada-Authorizes-Second-Online-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Authorizes Second Online Casino"></a>Nevada Authorizes Second Online Casino</h1><p>The Nevada Gaming Commission has unanimously approved the issuance of a state gaming license to an online casino owned and operated by the Las Vegas Sands Corporation. This is the second online casino to be authorized in Nevada, following the approval of an online casino operated by the Wynn Resorts Corporation in February of this year.</p>
<p>The Sands online casino will offer a full range of gaming options, including blackjack, roulette, and slots. It will also offer a variety of promotions and bonuses, including a first-time deposit bonus of $300 for new players.</p>
<p>The approval of the Sands casino marks another step forward for the legalisation of online gambling in the United States. Several other states are currently considering proposals to legalize online gambling, including California, New York, and Illinois.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Passes-Law-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Passes-Law-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Passes Law to Legalize Online Gambling"></a>Pennsylvania Passes Law to Legalize Online Gambling</h1><p>In what can be seen as a watershed moment for the gambling industry, on October 30th, Pennsylvania became the fourth state in the US to legalize online gambling. The law allows licensed casinos in the state to offer casino games and poker over the internet.</p>
<p>Industry experts have been predicting the legalization of online gambling for some time now, as states look for new ways to generate revenue and tap into an increasingly popular market. Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware were the first states to legalize online gambling in 2013, with Pennsylvania following suit four years later.</p>
<p>Opposition to online gambling has been muted, with many people arguing that it is a safer option than traditional forms of gambling like casino and sports betting. The new law in Pennsylvania also includes measures to protect players from problem gambling, such as a ban on sports betting and limits on how much people can spend on online gambling each week.</p>
<p>The passage of this law is likely to be good news for casino operators in Pennsylvania, who are facing increased competition from neighbouring states. Online gambling is expected to generate $204 million in revenue for casinos in Pennsylvania in its first year of operation, according to estimates by Moody’s.</p>
<p>The trend towards legalizing online gambling is likely to continue, as more states look for ways to increase their revenues without raising taxes. This is good news for consumers too, who will have access to a wider range of legal options when it comes to gambling.</p>
<h1 id="New-York-May-Be-Next-State-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling"><a href="#New-York-May-Be-Next-State-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="New York May Be Next State to Legalize Online Gambling"></a>New York May Be Next State to Legalize Online Gambling</h1><p>For years, the online gambling industry has operated in a legal gray area. While some states have chosen to legalize and regulate the activity, others have taken a more prohibition-based approach. But this balance may be about to change, as New York looks poised to become the next state to legalize online gambling.</p>
<p>The impetus for this change appears to be financial. New York is facing a budget shortfall of up to $4 billion, and online gambling could provide a much-needed revenue stream. In addition, there is evidence that legalization could create jobs and bring in new tourism dollars.</p>
<p>Legalization would also allow New York’s existing brick-and-mortar casinos to expand into the online marketplace. This would give them a competitive edge over casinos in other states, which are not currently able to offer online gambling.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no official announcement from the governor’s office regarding plans to legalize online gambling. But there is considerable momentum behind the effort, and it seems likely that something will happen in the near future.</p>
