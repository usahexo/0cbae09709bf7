The object of the game is to be the first player to collect four animal cards of the same kind.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-you-play"><a href="#How-do-you-play" class="headerlink" title="How do you play?"></a>How do you play?</h1><p>To play, each player is given a set of toy animals. One player starts by saying, “This is the _____ (name of animal). It says _____ (sound the animal makes).” For example, if you are playing with a monkey, hippo, lion and elephant cards, the first player might say, “This is the monkey. It says ook ook.” The next player then has to say, “This is the hippo. It says oink oink.” And so on until someone collects four cards of the same kind and wins the game.</p>

<h1 id="What-are-the-features-of-the-Cheeky-Monkeys-game"><a href="#What-are-the-features-of-the-Cheeky-Monkeys-game" class="headerlink" title="What are the features of the Cheeky Monkeys game?"></a>What are the features of the Cheeky Monkeys game?</h1><p>The Cheeky Monkeys game is a popular dice game that can be played by 2-6 players. The aim of the game is to score points by rolling dice and taking tricks. The player who scores the most points at the end of the game wins.</p>
<p>The Cheeky Monkeys game consists of a board, six monkeys, thirty-six cards, and six dice. The board is divided into four regions: forest, river, beach, and volcano. There are two paths along the edge of the board- one for each player. Players take turns rolling dice and moving their monkey along the path according to the numbers shown on the dice. If a player rolls two of the same number, they can take a trick using one of their cards.</p>
<p>When a player lands on a space with a monkey, they can take the card from that space. Cards can be used to take tricks or to score points. There are three types of cards- animals, objects, and numbers. Animals are worth 1 point, objects are worth 3 points, and numbers are worth 5 points. The player with the most points at the end of the game wins.</p>

<h1 id="How-do-I-play-the-Cheeky-Monkeys-game"><a href="#How-do-I-play-the-Cheeky-Monkeys-game" class="headerlink" title="How do I play the Cheeky Monkeys game?"></a>How do I play the Cheeky Monkeys game?</h1><p>The Cheeky Monkeys game is a simple but challenging puzzle game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages. The aim of the game is to help the cheeky monkeys reach the exit by rearranging the blocks in the level.</p>
<p>The controls are simple - use your mouse to click and drag the blocks around. You can also use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the blocks around.</p>
<p>There are a number of different blocks in the game, each with its own special ability. Here’s a brief overview of each block:</p>
<p>-Blue Blocks: These blocks can be pushed around by other blocks.</p>
<p>-Red Blocks: These blocks cannot be moved or pushed around.</p>
<p>-Green Blocks: These blocks can be moved and pushed around like blue blocks, but they also act as springs, bouncing other blocks off them when they come into contact.</p>
<p>-Yellow Blocks: These blocks are heavy and will fall down if there is no support beneath them. They can be used to weigh down other blocks or hold doors open.</p>
<p>There are also bonus items that you can collect in the game, such as coins and gems. The coins can be used to purchase hints, while the gems can be used to unlock new worlds.</p>
<p>To get started, select a world from the World Select screen. There are four different worlds to choose from, each with six levels. Once you have selected a world, you will need to complete all six levels in that world before progressing to the next one.</p>
<p>To complete a level, you must help all three of the cheeky monkeys reach the exit. You can do this by rearranging the blocks so that they create a path for the monkeys to follow. Some levels contain locked doors which can only be opened once all of the required blocks have been collected. If you run out of moves or time, you will lose and will have to start over from the beginning of the level.</p>
<p>Here are a few tips for getting started in the game:</p>
<p>-Don’t forget that you can use arrow keys on your keyboard to move blocks around. This might come in handy if your mouse isn’t working properly.<br>2-You can temporarily disable green springs by clicking on them twice - this might come in handy if you’re trying to line up a block next to them. 3-If you’re stuck on a level, try using some of the hints that are available for purchase with coins.</p>

The game is a five-reel slot machine with 20 paylines, and features a cheeky monkey character who oversees the action. Players can bet up to 10 coins per line, for a maximum bet of 200 coins.</p>
<p>The aim of the game is to land as many winning combinations as possible. Winning combinations start with three or more matching symbols on an enabled payline. The most lucrative symbol in the game is the monkey, which pays out 2,000 coins for five symbols. Other high paying symbols include the lion and the elephant, both of which pay out 1,000 coins for five symbols.</p>
<p>The Cheeky Monkeys game has a theoretical return to player (RTP) of 96.5%. This means that for every 100 coins played, players can expect to win back 96.5% of those coins in return. This RTP is in line with industry standards and ensures that players have a fair chance of winning when playing this game.</p>
<p>Overall, the Cheeky Monkeys game is a fun and rewarding casino game that offers players the chance to win big payouts. With an RTP of 96.5%, players can rest assured that they have a good chance of winning when playing this game.</p>
