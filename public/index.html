Irving scored 26 points on 10-of-16 shooting, including the game-winning three pointer with 53 seconds remaining.</p>
<p>Boston will now face the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Sixers stunned the top-seeded Toronto Raptors in five games to reach the conference finals for the first time since 2001.</p>
<h1 id="Golden-State-Warriors-complete-sweep-of-San-Antonio-Spurs"><a href="#Golden-State-Warriors-complete-sweep-of-San-Antonio-Spurs" class="headerlink" title="Golden State Warriors complete sweep of San Antonio Spurs"></a>Golden State Warriors complete sweep of San Antonio Spurs</h1><p>The Golden State Warriors completed a sweep of the San Antonio Spurs with a 119-113 victory in Game 4 of their Western Conference Finals on Monday.</p>
<p>The Warriors will now await the winner of the Houston Rockets and Oklahoma City Thunder series, which is currently tied at 2-2.</p>
<p>The win was not without controversy, as Spurs forward Kawhi Leonard left the game with an ankle injury midway through the third quarter. Leonard initially stayed in the game, but was later taken to the locker room and did not return.</p>
<p>Warriors guard Stephen Curry led all scorers with 33 points, while Kevin Durant added 32 points and 10 rebounds. Leonard finished with 26 points and 8 rebounds before leaving the game.</p>
<p>“It sucks to see him go out like that,” Durant said of Leonard. “He’s a great player, one of the best players in our league. It sucks to see him limping off the court like that.”</p>
<h1 id="Pittsburgh-Penguins-win-Stanley-Cup-in-thrilling-Game-Seven"><a href="#Pittsburgh-Penguins-win-Stanley-Cup-in-thrilling-Game-Seven" class="headerlink" title="Pittsburgh Penguins win Stanley Cup in thrilling Game Seven"></a>Pittsburgh Penguins win Stanley Cup in thrilling Game Seven</h1><p>The Pittsburgh Penguins capped off an amazing season on Thursday night, winning their second consecutive Stanley Cup in thrilling fashion with a 2-1 victory over the Nashville Predators in Game Seven.</p>
<p>It was a back-and-forth game throughout, with the Penguins scoring first before the Predators tied it up in the third period. But Pittsburgh’s Sidney Crosby proved to be the difference maker, scoring the game-winning goal with just over a minute remaining in regulation to send the Penguins faithful into delirium.</p>
<p>The victory gives goaltender Matt Murray - who was making his Stanley Cup debut - his second championship at just 22 years of age, cementing his place as one of the NHL’s greatest young players. For Crosby, it caps off a comeback season after dealing with injuries and off-ice issues early on.</p>
<p>“This is what it’s all about,” said Crosby after the game. “You work all year long for moments like this.”</p>
<p>Pittsburgh becomes only the second team in NHL history to win back-to-back titles, and owner Mario Lemieux becomes the first owner in any major North American sports league to win three championships.</p>
<h1 id="Chris-Paul-leads-Rockets-over-Jazz-in-decisive-Game-Seven"><a href="#Chris-Paul-leads-Rockets-over-Jazz-in-decisive-Game-Seven" class="headerlink" title="Chris Paul leads Rockets over Jazz in decisive Game Seven"></a>Chris Paul leads Rockets over Jazz in decisive Game Seven</h1><p>HOUSTON (AP) — Chris Paul had 27 points and 10 assists to help the Houston Rockets eliminate the Utah Jazz with a 105-92 victory in Game 7 of their Western Conference semifinal on Monday night.</p>
<p>The Rockets, who will face the Golden State Warriors in the conference finals, got a huge boost from Eric Gordon, who scored 24 points off the bench. Gordon hit five 3-pointers, including one that put Houston up 92-81 with less than five minutes left.</p>
<p>James Harden added 18 points for Houston.</p>
<p>Houston’s big fourth quarter allowed Paul to avoid having to make a decision on his future. The star guard is a free agent this summer and was expected to weigh his options after the season. But now he can focus on getting the Rockets back to the NBA Finals for the first time since 1995.</p>
<p>Houston will have its hands full with Golden State, which is coming off a sweep of San Antonio in the other Western Conference semifinal.</p>
<p>Rudy Gobert led Utah with 22 points and 15 rebounds, and Ricky Rubio added 17 points and 11 assists.</p>
<h1 id="Nashville-Predators-vs-Anaheim-Ducks-Who-will-come-out-on-top"><a href="#Nashville-Predators-vs-Anaheim-Ducks-Who-will-come-out-on-top" class="headerlink" title="Nashville Predators vs Anaheim Ducks: Who will come out on top?"></a>Nashville Predators vs Anaheim Ducks: Who will come out on top?</h1><p>The Nashville Predators and Anaheim Ducks will go head-to-head in the 2017 Western Conference Finals. The Ducks are coming into this matchup as the defending conference champions, but Nashville is not a team to be taken lightly. Let’s take a closer look at each of these teams and see who is likely to come out on top.</p>
<p>The Nashville Predators had an impressive run in the playoffs, knocking off the Chicago Blackhawks in six games and then taking down the St. Louis Blues in six games as well. They have been playing some of their best hockey of the season at just the right time and will be looking to continue their momentum against the Ducks. Pekka Rinne has been phenomenal in goal for Nashville, posting a save percentage of .947 in the playoffs. The defense has also been strong, led by Roman Josi and P.K. Subban. The Predators are a deep team that can score goals and play defense, which makes them a tough opponent for any team.</p>
<p>The Anaheim Ducks had a bit of a tougher road to the conference finals, needing seven games to get past both the Calgary Flames and Edmonton Oilers. However, they are coming into this matchup with all of their key players healthy and ready to go. Ryan Getzlaf, Corey Perry, Hampus Lindholm and Jakob Silfverberg all had an impact in the Ducks’ first round series against Calgary, with Getzlaf leading the team in scoring with 11 points (5 goals, 6 assists) in 7 games. The Ducks have also been getting strong goaltending from John Gibson, who is currently sporting a save percentage of .927 in the playoffs. Anaheim is no doubt a formidable opponent, but they will need to play their best hockey if they hope to upset Nashville.</p>
<p>So who will come out on top? It’s definitely going to be a close matchup, but I give the edge to the Nashville Predators. They have been playing great hockey lately and have more depth than Anaheim does. Rinne has also been outstanding between the pipes, which could be crucial in this series. I expect Nashville to win this series in six or seven games en route to making it to their first Stanley Cup Final appearance</p>

        <h1 id="Kofi-Annan-is-Retiring-from-the-United-Nations"><a href="#Kofi-Annan-is-Retiring-from-the-United-Nations" class="headerlink" title="Kofi Annan is Retiring from the United Nations"></a>Kofi Annan is Retiring from the United Nations</h1><p>Kofi Annan, the seventh secretary-general of the United Nations, is retiring from his post. Annan took over as the head of the UN in 1997 and has been a major advocate for promoting human rights around the world. He has also been a central figure in many global crises, such as the war in Iraq and the refugee crisis in Europe.</p>
<p>Annan has decided to step down in order to focus on peacebuilding and conflict resolution. In a statement released by his office, he said: “I feel privileged to have served as Secretary-General of the United Nations and deeply grateful to all those who have supported me and my team over the past twelve years.”</p>
<p>Ban Ki-moon, the current UN secretary-general, praised Annan for his many accomplishments during his tenure. “Kofi Annan is one of the great global leaders of our time,” Ban said. “He has worked tirelessly to promote peace, democracy, human rights and prosperity around the world.”</p>
<p>Annan’s legacy will be remembered for his work in promoting human rights and resolving conflict around the world. He is also well known for his efforts to make the UN more efficient and effective. In a statement announcing his retirement, Annan said: “The UN must be brought closer to people and allowed to act on their behalf more rapidly and effectively.”</p>
<h1 id="Kofi-Annan-named-Special-Envoy-to-help-Syrian-Peace-Talks"><a href="#Kofi-Annan-named-Special-Envoy-to-help-Syrian-Peace-Talks" class="headerlink" title="Kofi Annan named Special Envoy to help Syrian Peace Talks"></a>Kofi Annan named Special Envoy to help Syrian Peace Talks</h1><p>Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary-general, has been appointed as a special envoy to help revive Syrian peace talks.</p>
<p>The UN said Mr Annan will work with the group of nations known as the “Friends of Syria” to implement a peace plan that calls for a transitional government to lead Syria to democratic elections.</p>
<p>The move came as Syrian forces bombarded Homs for a 20th day and rebels killed 28 troops in two attacks on army checkpoints in Idlib province.</p>
<p>Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary-general, said he was grateful to Mr Annan for taking on the job.</p>
<p>“I am deeply troubled by the grave situation in Syria and the tragic loss of life,” he said. “Kofi has great experience and expertise in mediating complex disputes and I am sure he will bring all his wisdom and insight to this critical task.”</p>
<p>Annan accepted the job despite his reservations about international intervention. In an interview with CNN, he said: “I am not a superhero, and I can’t do it alone.” </p>
<p>He also said that there was no military solution to the conflict and called for urgent dialogue between all sides.<br>“It is incumbent on those with influence to help nudge the parties towards constructive dialogue and avoid further bloodshed,” he said.</p>
<h1 id="Kofi-Annan-urges-more-support-for-Syrians"><a href="#Kofi-Annan-urges-more-support-for-Syrians" class="headerlink" title="Kofi Annan urges more support for Syrians"></a>Kofi Annan urges more support for Syrians</h1><p>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres (seen above with Kofi Annan) appointed a new envoy to Syria on Thursday, August 24, amid warnings of potential a new humanitarian disaster in the rebel-held Idlib province.</p>
<p>Kofi Annan, who served as the UN’s special envoy to Syria from February 2012 until he resigned in August 2012, has urged the international community to provide more support to Syrians. The Syrian conflict has killed more than 330,000 people and displaced millions since it began in 2011.</p>
<p>“The fall of Aleppo was a turning point in the war,” said Annan. “There must be consequences for those who continue to flout international law.”</p>
<p>The UN Security Council is scheduled to hold a meeting on Syria on Friday, August 25.</p>
<h1 id="Kofi-Annan-a-voice-of-reason-during-turbulent-times"><a href="#Kofi-Annan-a-voice-of-reason-during-turbulent-times" class="headerlink" title="Kofi Annan: a voice of reason during turbulent times"></a>Kofi Annan: a voice of reason during turbulent times</h1><p>Kofi Annan, the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations, passed away on August 18, 2018, after a brief illness. He was 80 years old.</p>
<p>Born in Ghana on April 8, 1938, Annan devoted his life to service. He was an accomplished diplomat who represented his country at the United Nations for more than two decades. In 1997, he was appointed UN Secretary-General by the UN Security Council, and he served until 2006.</p>
<p>Annan was known for his calm demeanor and his ability to navigate through difficult challenges. During his time as UN Secretary-General, he faced numerous global crises, including the terrorist attacks of September 11th and the war in Iraq. He also worked to reform the UN bureaucracy and improve human rights around the world.</p>
<p>In 2001, Annan was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize “for efforts to revitalize the organization and to establish democracy in international relations.” He was widely respected for his principled leadership and his dedication to peace and human rights.</p>
<p>Following his tenure as UN Secretary-General, Annan founded the Kofi Annan Foundation, which works to promote peacebuilding, conflict resolution, and sustainable development. He remained engaged in global affairs until his death, lending his voice to important issues such as climate change and refugees.</p>
<p>Kofi Annan was a dedicated public servant and a tireless advocate for peace and human rights. His legacy will be remembered for many years to come.</p>
<h1 id="Remembering-Kofi-Annan-former-U-N-secretary-general"><a href="#Remembering-Kofi-Annan-former-U-N-secretary-general" class="headerlink" title="Remembering Kofi Annan, former U.N. secretary-general"></a>Remembering Kofi Annan, former U.N. secretary-general</h1><p>Kofi Annan, the former U.N. secretary-general, passed away on Saturday at the age of 80. He was a Ghanaian diplomat who dedicated his life to public service, and will be remembered for his work in advancing human rights and peace.</p>
<p>Annan was born in Kumasi, Ghana, in 1938. After graduating from college, he began his career as a diplomat for the West African nations of Ivory Coast and Ghana. In 1971, he was appointed as deputy head of mission at the U.N. headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. He subsequently served as Under-Secretary-General for Political Affairs, and then as acting Secretary-General when Boutros Boutros-Ghali resigned in 1996.</p>
<p>Annan was elected Secretary-General later that year, becoming the first black African to hold the position. During his tenure, he worked to expand the role of the U.N. in response to global crises such as the September 11th terrorist attacks and the Iraq War. He also made strides in promoting human rights and fighting poverty worldwide. In 2001, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize “for efforts to revitalize the organization and to enable it to better respond to 21st century challenges.”</p>
<p>After stepping down as Secretary-General in 2006, Annan continued to serve as a U.N. special envoy for humanitarian issues and peacekeeping operations. He also founded The Kofi Annan Foundation, which works to promote good governance and sustainable development around the world.</p>
<p>In a statement following Annan’s death, U.N. General Assembly President Miroslav Lajčák said “Kofi Annan was someone who always looked out for others before himself […] He was humanity’s best example, its biggest champion and its most articulate spokesman […] We have lost a great man; we have lost an irreplaceable leader […] But even more importantly than what we have lost is what Kofi leaves behind – an example of how one can live one’s life with purpose.”</p>
<p>Kofi Annan will be remembered as one of the most accomplished diplomats of our time, and his work in promoting peace and human rights will continue to impact people all over the world</p>

If you’re not sure how to play a particular game, there are usually plenty of people around who can help teach you how to play.</p>
<p>The best part about playing slot machines in Kansas is that the odds are always in your favor. Unlike other casino games like blackjack or roulette, slot machines don’t require any skill or strategy. All you need is a bit of luck and you could be on your way to winning big!</p>

Annan to Play Video Poker Deuces Outdoors at the United Nations Headquarters in New York"></a>Kofi A. Annan to Play Video Poker Deuces Outdoors at the United Nations Headquarters in New York</h1><p>Kofi A. Annan, the former seventh secretary-general of the United Nations, was caught playing video poker deuces outdoors at the United Nations Headquarters in New York last Tuesday.</p>
<p>According to eyewitnesses, Annan was sitting at a picnic bench near the UN’s Dag Hammarskjold Library when he began playing the game on his cellphone. He then became engrossed in the game and continued playing for over an hour, even as people walked by.</p>
<p>When approached by a reporter, Annan said that he often played video poker deuces outdoors to relax and clear his mind. “It’s a fun game and it helps me focus,” he said. “I can play it anywhere, so I didn’t see any reason not to play it at the UN.”</p>
<p>Annan also denied that he was wasting taxpayers’ money by playing the game outdoors. “The UN is a public institution and I have a right to use its grounds,” he said. “I’m not doing anything wrong.”</p>
<p>Despite Annan’s assertion that there is nothing wrong with playing video poker deuces outdoors at the UN, some experts believe that he should set a better example for other UN employees. “Playing video poker deuces outdoors isn’t exactly the healthiest or most productive thing to do at work,” said one expert. “Annan should try to be more mindful of how he spends his time at the UN.”</p>
<h1 id="Kofi-A-Annan-to-Play-Video-Poker-Deuces-Outdoors-at-the-United-Nations-Building-in-Geneva"><a href="#Kofi-A-Annan-to-Play-Video-Poker-Deuces-Outdoors-at-the-United-Nations-Building-in-Geneva" class="headerlink" title="Kofi A. Annan to Play Video Poker Deuces Outdoors at the United Nations Building in Geneva"></a>Kofi A. Annan to Play Video Poker Deuces Outdoors at the United Nations Building in Geneva</h1><p>Kofi Annan is a Ghanaian diplomat who served as the seventh Secretary-General of the United Nations from January 1997 to December 2006. He was the first member of an African country to hold the post. On 14 December 2006, Annan and the United Nations were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.</p>
<p>Annan announced in March 2007 that he would not seek a second term as Secretary-General. In February 2008, he co-founded the Kofi Annan Foundation, which focuses on international development, humanitarianism, and conflict resolution.</p>
<p>Now, at age 81, Annan will add one more line to his impressive resume: professional gambler. He has announced that he will play in the $2,500 buy-in Deuces Wild Video Poker Tournament at the 2018 World Series of Poker (WSOP) in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Deuces Wild is a variant of video poker in which all deuces (2s) are wild cards. This increases the player’s chances of making a winning hand. The tournament begins on July 2 and consists of five days of action.</p>
<p>Annan is no stranger to casino gaming; he has been known to enjoy blackjack and roulette in his free time. But this will be his first time playing poker in a competitive setting. “I am looking forward to it,” Annan said of the tournament. “It should be fun.”</p>
<p>The former UN Secretary-General has already qualified for the $10,000 Main Event at the WSOP; now he’s set his sights on making a deep run in the Deuces Wild tournament. “I don’t know how good I am,” Annan joked, “but I am sure I can hold my own against most people.”</p>
<p>Whether or not Annan succeeds in his poker quest remains to be seen, but one thing is for sure: he’ll always be remembered as one of the most impressive figures in UN history.</p>

<p>“I am looking forward to playing some video poker deuces outdoors at the United Nations Headquarters in Rome this Sunday with some friends,” said Annan. “It should be a lot of fun.”</p>
<p>Annan is no stranger to playing video poker deuces outdoors; he has played the game at various locations around the world over the past several years.</p>
<p>“I have played video poker deuces outdoors all over the world, including in Switzerland, Spain, and Japan,” said Annan. “I am confident I can win this game at the United Nations Headquarters in Rome as well.”</p>
<p>The video poker deuces outdoor game at the United Nations Headquarters in Rome is expected to draw large crowds of spectators.</p>

<p>Annan will join other dignitaries from around the world for the tournament, which will benefit the work of UNICEF.</p>
<p>“I am very much looking forward to playing in this exciting video poker tournament at the United Nations Headquarters in Vienna,” Annan said in a statement. “It will be a fun and unique way to support UNICEF’s work helping children in need around the world.”</p>
<p>Deuces Wild is a variant of video poker in which all 2s are wildcards. In most variants of video poker, wildcards can be used as any card to form a winning hand.</p>

<p>In a statement, Mr Annan said he was looking forward to “a good game of poker and some fresh air in Berlin”.</p>
<p>Video poker deuces outdoors is an unusual choice for an event at the United Nations headquarters, butFilm fest director Dieter Kosslick said it fitted with the festival’s theme of “out of the box”.</p>
<p>“We are very happy that Kofi Annan has agreed to play in our tournament,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr Annan will be playing for the Kofi Annan Foundation, which aims to promote peace and sustainable development.</p>

The first is a poker hand made up of two pairs, one pair being aces and eights. The second is a slang term for an electroshock weapon that was used by police officers and security guards.</p>
<p>The origin of the phrase “dead man’s hand” is unknown, but it is thought to date back to the mid-19th century. One possible explanation is that it was inspired by the Ace of Spades, which was sometimes called the “death card.”</p>
<p>The Ace of Spades was thought to be unlucky because it was often included in decks that were used for gambling. Some people believe that the phrase “dead man’s hand” originated from a story about Wild Bill Hickok, who was allegedly killed with a pair of aces and eights.</p>
<p>In recent years, the phrase has been popularized by the television show Deadwood, which is set in the Wild West.</p>

It can be played with any number of players, but is typically best with five or six. The game is named for the five card hand that comprises dead man’s hand: two pair, aces and eights.</p>
<p>The objective of the game is to win as many chips from the other players as possible. The player with the best hand at the end of the hand wins all of the chips from the other players. The rank of hands in this game are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Five of a kind</li>
<li>Four of a kind</li>
<li>Full house</li>
<li>Flush</li>
<li>Straight</li>
<li>Three of a kind</li>
<li>Two pair</li>
<li>One pair</li>
<li>High card</li>

It gets its name from the infamous outlaw and gambler, Wild Bill Hickok, who was holding this very hand when he was shot and killed in 1876.</p>
<p>While the Dead Man’s Hand may not be the strongest hand in poker, it is still a formidable foe that should not be taken lightly. In fact, Doyle Brunson famously won the World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Event twice with this hand.</p>
<p>So, if you find yourself in a situation where you are holding the Dead Man’s Hand, what should you do?</p>
<p>Well, first and foremost, you need to know your odds. In most cases, your chances of winning will be around 27%. However, this can vary depending on the game being played and the other players at the table.</p>
<p>With that in mind, your goal should be to play cautiously and let your opponents take the risks. remember, even with a strong hand like this one, there is always the chance of losing so you don’t want to put all your chips in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Instead, try to keep your bets small and wait for a good opportunity to make a big move. And if you do end up losing with the Dead Man’s Hand, don’t feel bad; after all, you’re playing against some of the best players in the world.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Play-the-Dead-Man’s-Hand-in-Poker"><a href="#How-to-Play-the-Dead-Man’s-Hand-in-Poker" class="headerlink" title="How to Play the Dead Man’s Hand in Poker"></a>How to Play the Dead Man’s Hand in Poker</h1><p>The Dead Man’s Hand is a powerful hand in poker that can win you a lot of money. In order to play the hand correctly, you need to know what it is and how to use it.</p>
<p>The Dead Man’s Hand is made up of two pair, aces and eights. This hand is so named because it was the hand Wild Bill Hickok was holding when he was shot and killed.</p>
<p>This hand is not as strong as a royal flush, but it is still very powerful. If you are able to get all of the cards in the right places, you can win a lot of money with this hand.</p>
<p>There are several things that you need to keep in mind when playing the Dead Man’s Hand. First, make sure that you are familiar with the odds of getting each card. Second, be aware of what hands your opponents might have.</p>
<p>Third, remember that this hand can easily be beaten by a better hand. Finally, know when to fold this hand and when to keep playing.</p>

The first thing that you should do is to try and raise the stakes as high as possible. This will force your opponents to fold, and it will also make it difficult for them to hit their draw.</p>
<p>You should also consider betting aggressively on the flop. If you can make a strong bet on the flop, your opponents will be forced to fold if they don’t have a strong hand. Remember, the goal is to make it as difficult as possible for your opponents to win the hand.</p>
<p>If your opponents do hit their draw on the turn or river, you should be prepared to fold. There is no point in fighting for a pot that you cannot win. By folding when necessary, you can minimize your losses and preserve your chip stack.</p>
<p>In short, if you are dealt the dead man’s hand in poker, there are a few things that you can do to improve your chances of winning the hand. Try to raise the stakes as high as possible, bet aggressively on the flop, and be prepared to fold if necessary.</p>

The local Bundesliga club, Borussia Mönchengladbach, has been a mainstay in the top division of German football for over four decades. But the club’s history goes back even further than that.</p>
<p>Borussia was founded in 1900, and played its first game just two years later. The club was initially a member of the Verband Westdeutscher Spielkarten-Vereine (the Association of Western German Card Clubs), which is where it got its name – Borussia is the Latin term for Prussia.</p>
<p>In its early years, Borussia was a successful side, winning the Westphalian championship in 1911 and 1913. However, it would be another four decades until the team achieved any real success.</p>
<p>In 1970, Borussia Mönchengladbach reached the final of the European Cup Winners’ Cup, where they faced English side Chelsea. The match went to a replay after finishing level at 2-2 after extra time. However, Chelsea would eventually prevail, winning 3-2 to lift the trophy.</p>
<p>The 1970s were a golden era for Borussia Mönchengladbach. The team would go on to win five Bundesliga titles, as well as two DFB-Pokals (German Cup) and one UEFA Cup. In total, they reached seven major European finals – more than any other club at that time.</p>
<p>Borussia’s form has waxed and waned since those heady days in the 1970s, but they remain one of Germany’s most popular clubs. Each weekend, tens of thousands of fans make their way to the Borussia Park stadium to cheer on their heroes. And now there’s an added incentive to do so – free chips!</p>

    </h1>
  

      </header>
    
    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="Dodgers-Bettors-Feasted-in-Early-Wagering-Action"><a href="#Dodgers-Bettors-Feasted-in-Early-Wagering-Action" class="headerlink" title="Dodgers Bettors Feasted in Early Wagering Action"></a>Dodgers Bettors Feasted in Early Wagering Action</h1><p>The Los Angeles Dodgers were big favorites in their matchup against the Atlanta Braves on Wednesday, and that was reflected in the early betting action.</p>
<p>At sportsbooks monitored by OddsShark.com, the Dodgers opened as high as -280 favorites, with moneyline odds of -1,100. They would go on to win the game 5-2, but those who bet on Los Angeles early missed out on some hefty profits.</p>
<p>Had a bettor put down $100 on the Dodgers to win Wednesday, they would have only Profited $14.29. In fact, only two of LAD’s last ten games have resulted in a payout higher than $14.29 for a $100 bettor.</p>
<p>Conversely, while the Braves may have lost Wednesday night, they proved to be a viable betting option earlier in the day. Atlanta opened as low as +220 underdogs at some sportsbooks and +1,000 on the moneyline. This meant that a $100 wager on the Braves would have resulted in a Profit of $220.</p>
<p>Wednesday wasn’t an anomaly for Atlanta, who has gone 7-3 over their last ten games against the spread. With eight games remaining on their schedule, including matchups against both Washington and Miami—two top teams in the National League—the Braves could provide plenty more profitable betting opportunities before the season comes to a close.</p>
<h1 id="Sharp-Dodgers-Bettors-Enjoyed-Early-Success"><a href="#Sharp-Dodgers-Bettors-Enjoyed-Early-Success" class="headerlink" title="Sharp Dodgers Bettors Enjoyed Early Success"></a>Sharp Dodgers Bettors Enjoyed Early Success</h1><p>The Dodgers had a great first half of the season, and sharp bettors who jumped on their odds early were well rewarded. Bettors who got down at +375 on the Dodgers to win the World Series found themselves up over 50% at the end of July.</p>
<p>While the Dodgers have come back down to earth in recent weeks, they are still one of the top teams in baseball and remain a favorite to win the World Series. At their current odds of +450, sharp bettors can still make a healthy profit by betting on them to win it all.</p>
<p>The Cubs are currently the favorites to win the World Series, with odds of +350, but the Dodgers are right behind them and offer much better value. If you believe that LA is going to win it all, now is the time to place your bets.</p>
<h1 id="Dodgers-Bettors-Had-Edge-in-Early-Wagering-Action"><a href="#Dodgers-Bettors-Had-Edge-in-Early-Wagering-Action" class="headerlink" title="Dodgers Bettors Had Edge in Early Wagering Action"></a>Dodgers Bettors Had Edge in Early Wagering Action</h1><p>The Los Angeles Dodgers were the betting favorites going into their first game of the National League Championship Series against the Milwaukee Brewers, and that was evident in the early wagering action.</p>
<p>According to oddsmakers from online sportsbook Bovada, the Dodgers were sizable -165 favorites to win Tuesday’s matchup. The Brewers, on the other hand, were +145 underdogs.</p>
<p>That lopsided betting trend continued into Wednesday’s game. Los Angeles was once again favored by -165, while Milwaukee was +145 underdogs.</p>
<p>So far, those odds have held up as the Dodgers have taken a 2-0 lead in the series. They will look to close things out in Milwaukee on Friday with Zack Greinke on the mound. The Brewers will counter with Gio Gonzalez.</p>
<h1 id="Dodgers-Bettors-Found-Plenty-of-Value-in-Early-Wagering"><a href="#Dodgers-Bettors-Found-Plenty-of-Value-in-Early-Wagering" class="headerlink" title="Dodgers Bettors Found Plenty of Value in Early Wagering"></a>Dodgers Bettors Found Plenty of Value in Early Wagering</h1><p>The Los Angeles Dodgers have been one of the most popular teams to wager on so far this season, and the early returns have been largely positive for those who backed them. Despite a bit of a slow start, the Dodgers are still in first place in the National League West and are +1100 to win the World Series, according to odds from MyBookie.ag.</p>
<p>For the most part, the Dodgers have performed well against the spread (ATS) this year. They are currently 27-23-1 ATS, which is good for third in their division. Bettors who backed them when they were underdogs (9-10 ATS) have fared relatively well, as LA has won six of those games.</p>
<p>As with any bet, there have been some losers along the way, but that is to be expected when wagering on a team with such high odds to win the championship. Overall, though, those who have wagered on the Dodgers have found plenty of value.</p>
<p>There are a few reasons for this. First and foremost, LA is a very good team and should be favored in most games they play. Additionally, they play in a weak division and should easily make the playoffs. Finally, their odds to win the World Series are much higher than most other teams, so there is great potential for profit if they do end up winning it all.</p>
<p>It’s still too early in the season to make any definitive statements about how things will play out, but those who continue to back the Dodgers can be confident that they will at least provide some good value going forward.</p>
<h1 id="Sharp-Dodgers-Bettors-Came-Out-on-Top-in-Early-Wagering"><a href="#Sharp-Dodgers-Bettors-Came-Out-on-Top-in-Early-Wagering" class="headerlink" title="Sharp Dodgers Bettors Came Out on Top in Early Wagering"></a>Sharp Dodgers Bettors Came Out on Top in Early Wagering</h1><p>The Los Angeles Dodgers started the season red hot and reached a new high on Tuesday night with a 5-1 victory over the rival San Francisco Giants. L.A. began the week as +500 underdogs at Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook, but even sharp bettors were on them early, taking the Dodgers down to +400 within 36 hours of opening. Bettors who sided with Dodgers early in the betting enjoyed a nice return on investment on Tuesday night and likely could have cashed even bigger had they waited until late in the week when L.A.’s odds dipped to as low as +325.</p>
<p>The Dodgers are now 18-9 overall and sit atop the NL West standings, just 2.5 games ahead of the defending World Series champion Giants. Clayton Kershaw continued his sensational start to the season on Tuesday night, striking out nine while allowing just one run in eight innings of work. The reigning Cy Young Award winner lowered his ERA to 1.73 and is off to one of the best starts in recent memory.</p>
<p>Even though Dodgers odds have consistently been lower than those of their opponents this season, there is still value to be found when betting on them, especially at home where they are 9-4 on the year. With Kershaw and other aces like Zack Greinke leading the way, L.A. is primed for another successful campaign and should be able to continue winning games against some of baseball’s best teams.</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="How-To-Become-A-Millionaire-Betting-On-Newcastle-United-FC"><a href="#How-To-Become-A-Millionaire-Betting-On-Newcastle-United-FC" class="headerlink" title="How To Become A Millionaire Betting On Newcastle United FC"></a>How To Become A Millionaire Betting On Newcastle United FC</h1><p>There is no doubt that Newcastle United FC is one of the most popular and supported teams in the English Premier League. This support has led to the team having one of the highest average home attendances in the league. And with a passionate fan base like that, it’s no wonder that some people are looking to make a killing by betting on Newcastle United FC matches.</p>
<p>But for those who are new to betting on football matches, it can be a daunting task trying to figure out where and how to start. So in this article, we will provide you with some tips on how to become a millionaire betting on Newcastle United FC.</p>
<p>Before getting into any specific tips though, it’s important to first understand how odds work when betting on football matches. In general, odds reflect the likelihood of an event occurring. So for example, if you were to bet £10 on Newcastle United FC winning their next match, and they were given odds of 6/4, you would stand to win £16 (including your original stake). So as you can see, the higher the odds are against a team winning, the more money you stand to win if they do pull off an upset victory.</p>
<p>Now that you have a basic understanding of odds, let’s take a look at some tips on how to become a millionaire betting on Newcastle United FC:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do Your Research</li>
</ol>
<p>The first thing you need to do before placing any bets is to do your research. This includes reading up on news and injury reports relating to both Newcastle United FC and their opponents. By having a good understanding of each team’s form and injuries heading into a match, you will be in a much better position to make informed predictions about how the match might play out.</p>
<p>2)shop Around for The Best Odds</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, having accurate knowledge of the odds for any given match is essential when it comes to successful betting. So make sure you shop around for the best odds available from different bookmakers before placing any bets. This could potentially save you a lot of money in the long run.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Bet On Multiple Matches Each Week</li>
</ol>
<p>Another great way to increase your chances of making money betting on Newcastle United FC is by betting on multiple matches each week. By spreading your bets out across several different matches, even if you don’t get all of them right, you will still stand to make a profit overall. This also helps minimise losses if one or two particular bets end up not going your way.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Avoid backing Newcastle United FC too heavily</li>
</ol>
<p>Although it may be tempting to back Newcastle United FC heavily in order to maximise your potential winnings, it’s important not to go overboard. Remember that even though they are [a very] good team, they are not invincible and there is always the chance that they might lose a match. So by diversifying your bets across different teams and matches as we mentioned earlier, you can help reduce the risk of losing money if/when Newcastle does happen to lose a game.</p>
<h1 id="Newcastle-United-FC-How-To-Turn-£10-Into-£1-000"><a href="#Newcastle-United-FC-How-To-Turn-£10-Into-£1-000" class="headerlink" title="Newcastle United FC: How To Turn £10 Into £1,000"></a>Newcastle United FC: How To Turn £10 Into £1,000</h1><p>In today’s economy, it can be difficult to make your money go further. However, there are a few ways that you can turn a small investment into a larger sum of money over time. Newcastle United Football Club (NUFC) is one of these methods.</p>
<p>For just £10, you can purchase a share in Newcastle United FC and become a part owner of the club. In addition to having a say in how the team is run, you will also receive dividends annually based on the club’s profits. In the 2017/18 season, NUFC paid out £1 per share, meaning that those who held shares at the end of the season earned £1,000 on their original investment.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t live near Newcastle and are not able to attend any matches, you can still benefit from your ownership of NUFC shares. The club has a global fan base, which means that your shares will be traded on the open market. This gives you the potential to make even more money if the team does well commercially or enjoys success on the pitch.</p>
<p>So, if you want to make some extra money with little risk and minimal effort, then investing in Newcastle United FC is definitely worth considering.</p>

<h1 id="How-Newcastle-United-FC-Can-Make-You-A-Millionaire"><a href="#How-Newcastle-United-FC-Can-Make-You-A-Millionaire" class="headerlink" title="How Newcastle United FC Can Make You A Millionaire"></a>How Newcastle United FC Can Make You A Millionaire</h1><p>The 2017/2018 Premier League season is now underway, and with it comes the opportunity to make some serious profits by betting on the matches.</p>
<p>There are a number of teams that offer good betting value, but one in particular that I believe offers exceptional value for money is Newcastle United.</p>
<p>They may have lost their opening game of the season against Tottenham Hotspur, but I still believe they can pull off a few surprises this year and score some big wins.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to make some serious profits this season, then here are three reasons why you should consider betting on Newcastle United FC:</p>
<ol>
<li>They Have A Good Squad With A lot Of Potential</li>
</ol>
<p>Despite their loss to Tottenham Hotspur in their opening game of the season, Newcastle United still have a very good squad with a lot of potential. In particular, they have some very strong attacking players like Joselu and Dwight Gayle who could easily score a few goals this season.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Their Home Games Are Very Winnable</li>
</ol>
<p>Newcastle United’s home games are generally very winnable, and I would expect them to pick up at least a few victories at St James’ Park this season. In fact, their first home game of the season against Huddersfield Town is already being labelled as a “ banker ” by many bookmakers.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The Odds Are Very Good For Betting On Them</li>
</ol>
<p>The odds for betting on Newcastle United are generally very good, so you can make a healthy profit even if they only manage to win a few games this season. In fact, some bookmakers are currently offering odds of 5/1 for them to win the Premier League title!</p>
<h1 id="The-Truth-About-Sports-Betting-amp-Newcastle-United-FC-How-Anyone-Can-Become-A-Millionaire"><a href="#The-Truth-About-Sports-Betting-amp-Newcastle-United-FC-How-Anyone-Can-Become-A-Millionaire" class="headerlink" title="The Truth About Sports Betting &amp; Newcastle United FC: How Anyone Can Become A Millionaire"></a>The Truth About Sports Betting &amp; Newcastle United FC: How Anyone Can Become A Millionaire</h1><p>The odds are always in favour of the house, or so the saying goes.<br>16th century mathematicians and gamblers, Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat, first came up with what is now known as the Pascal’s Wager . The basic premise is that it’s better to bet on God, because if you’re right, you gain eternal happiness; but if you’re wrong, you lose nothing.</p>
<p> Newcastle United FC is a team that has been around since 1892. They are a Premier League football club that play their home games at St James’ Park in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. The club has had a lot of success over the years, but they have also experienced some pretty low points. One of those low points was their relegation from the Premier League in 2009.</p>
<p>Relegation may have been a low point for the club, but it was certainly a high point for bookmakers around the world. Whenever a team experiences relegation there is usually an influx of bets placed on them to return to their previous division. This isn’t just restricted to relegated teams though - any team can be subject to these kinds of bets.</p>
<p>One thing that should be noted about these types of bets is that they are never really about who will win or lose the match. Sure, there is an element of that involved, but what people are really betting on is how long it will take for the team to return to their previous division (or higher). This means that even if your team loses, you can still make money by betting on them!</p>
<p>Of course, this brings us to Newcastle United FC and their relegation from the Premier League in 2009. Bookmakers all over the world were rubbing their hands with glee at the prospect of taking everyone’s money on Newcastle United FC returning to the Premier League at short odds. It didn’t happen though and they ended up being relegated all the way down to Football League Two (the fourth tier of English football).</p>
<p>Anyone who put money on Newcastle United FC returning to the Premier League at short odds would have lost out big time. In fact, it’s highly likely that they would have ended up being in debt! This goes to show that you should never bet on something which you don’t know enough about. Just because a team is favourites to win doesn’t mean that they will actually do so.</p>
<p>This isn’t just restricted to sports betting either - it applies to all forms of gambling. For example, casino games like blackjack can be beaten by following simple rules and strategies . If you don’t know what you’re doing though, you’re likely to end up losing a lot of money.<br>Sites like instantcasinoplay allow players to try out different casino games for free before playing for real money. This means that you can learn how to play blackjack before risking any of your own money. There’s no need to feel intimidated by casinos - just take things slow and steady and you’ll be fine!</p>
