        <h1 id="The-American-Psychiatric-Association-removes-gambling-disorder-from-the-list-of-impulse-control-disorders"><a href="#The-American-Psychiatric-Association-removes-gambling-disorder-from-the-list-of-impulse-control-disorders" class="headerlink" title="The American Psychiatric Association removes gambling disorder from the list of impulse control disorders"></a>The American Psychiatric Association removes gambling disorder from the list of impulse control disorders</h1><p>In a surprise move, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) announced today that it is removing gambling disorder from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the standard classification of mental disorders used by mental health professionals in the United States.</p>
<p>The decision to remove gambling disorder from the DSM was made by the APA’s Board of Trustees during their annual meeting in San Francisco. In a statement, APA CEO Saul Levin said that “after careful consideration, we determined that gambling disorder does not meet the criteria for a mental disorder.”</p>
<p>The decision to remove gambling disorder from the DSM has been met with mixed reactions. Some experts believe that gambling disorder is not a real mental disorder, while others argue that it is too soon to make such a decision without further research.</p>
<p>Gambling disorder is characterized by an inability to resist impulses to gamble, which leads to negative consequences such as financial problems, job loss, and relationship conflicts. The condition is estimated to affect up to 2 percent of the population.</p>
<h1 id="The-decision-to-remove-gambling-disorder-from-the-list-of-impulse-control-disorders-has-sparked-controversy"><a href="#The-decision-to-remove-gambling-disorder-from-the-list-of-impulse-control-disorders-has-sparked-controversy" class="headerlink" title="The decision to remove gambling disorder from the list of impulse control disorders has sparked controversy"></a>The decision to remove gambling disorder from the list of impulse control disorders has sparked controversy</h1><p>The decision by the World Health Organization (WHO) to remove gambling disorder from the list of impulse control disorders has sparked controversy within the scientific community. Gambling disorder is a mental health condition characterized by an uncontrollable urge to gamble, which can lead to significant financial and personal problems.</p>
<p>The decision to move gambling disorder out of the impulse control disorders category was made in light of new evidence that suggests it is better suited for inclusion in the addiction category. The WHO stated that gambling disorder shares many common features with substance addictions, such as impaired control over behavior, craving, and relapse.</p>
<p>Critics of the decision argue that gambling disorder should remain classified as an impulse control disorder because it is more closely related to disorders like obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and trichotillomania (hair pulling), which are also considered impulse control disorders. They point out that these other disorders are much less prevalent than addiction and that removing gambling disorder from the impulse control disorders category could lead to increased rates of misdiagnosis.</p>
<p>Supporters of the decision argue that there is a large body of evidence demonstrating that gambling disorder is best classified as an addiction. They say that moves like this are necessary in order to properly classify and treat mental health conditions.</p>
<p>The debate over whether or not gambling disorder should be classified as an addiction will likely continue for some time. However, the WHO’s decision has generated a lot of discussion about this serious mental health condition.</p>
<h1 id="Experts-debate-the-reasons-for-why-gambling-disorder-was-removed-from-the-list-of-impulse-control-disorders"><a href="#Experts-debate-the-reasons-for-why-gambling-disorder-was-removed-from-the-list-of-impulse-control-disorders" class="headerlink" title="Experts debate the reasons for why gambling disorder was removed from the list of impulse control disorders"></a>Experts debate the reasons for why gambling disorder was removed from the list of impulse control disorders</h1><p>In 2013, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), which is published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), removed gambling disorder from its list of impulse control disorders. The decision to remove gambling disorder from the DSM has been a topic of debate among experts in the field of mental health.</p>
<p>Some experts believe that gambling disorder was removed from the DSM because there is a lack of evidence to support its inclusion as an impulse control disorder. Others believe that the removal of gambling disorder from the DSM was due to politics and financial considerations.</p>
<p>Gambling disorder is a condition in which a person has an uncontrollable urge to gamble, even if they know that gambling is damaging to themselves and their loved ones. Gambling disorder can lead to financial problems, ruined relationships, and even criminal behavior.</p>
<p>There is strong evidence to support the inclusion of gambling disorder as an impulse control disorder. Studies have shown that people with gambling disorder have difficulty resisting urges to gamble, they often gamble despite negative consequences, and they have a strong desire to gamble.</p>
<p>The decision to remove gambling disorder from the DSM was based on politics and financial considerations, not on evidence. The American Psychiatric Association received funding from casino interests and it is believed that this funding played a role in the decision to remove gambling disorder from the DSM.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-disorder-is-now-considered-a-behavioral-addiction-rather-than-an-impulse-control-disorder"><a href="#Gambling-disorder-is-now-considered-a-behavioral-addiction-rather-than-an-impulse-control-disorder" class="headerlink" title="Gambling disorder is now considered a behavioral addiction, rather than an impulse control disorder"></a>Gambling disorder is now considered a behavioral addiction, rather than an impulse control disorder</h1><p>Gambling disorder is now considered a behavioral addiction, according to the most recent edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). This change reflects growing evidence that gambling disorder is a real and serious addiction, caused by changes in the brain associated with compulsive behavior.</p>
<p>Gambling disorder has long been seen as a lesser addiction, compared to substance abuse disorders. This may be in part due to the social stigma associated with gambling. But it’s also because gambling disorder was seen as less serious than addictions to substances like alcohol or drugs.</p>
<p>Now that gambling disorder is recognized as a behavioral addiction, this may help to break down some of the stigma surrounding it. It will also help to get people with this disorder the treatment they need.</p>
<p>What is gambling disorder?</p>
<p>Gambling disorder is a condition characterized by compulsive gambling behavior. People with this disorder can’t control their urge to gamble, no matter how much negative consequences it causes in their life. They may gamble away money they can’t afford to lose, or rack up huge debts from gambling. They may also lose important relationships or jobs due to their gambling addiction.</p>
<p>But even though these negative consequences mount, people with gambling disorder can’t stop themselves from gambling. They may continue to gamble even when they know it’s causing them harm. This irresistible urge to gamble is what defines compulsive behavior and marks gambling disorder as an addiction.</p>
<p>What causes gambling disorder?</p>
<p>The cause of gambling disorder is not yet known, but there are likely many factors at play. Some people may be more prone to developing a gambling addiction due to genes or brain chemistry. Others may be more likely to develop this problem if they grew up in a home where there was lots of exposure to gambling. Or if they started betting at a young age.</p>
<p>And finally, environmental factors such as stress or boredom may contribute to someone’s risk of developing a gambling addiction. So there are many different things that may contribute to someone becoming addicted to gambling. But currently, we don’t know everything about what causes this problem.</p>
<p>How common is gambling disorder?</p>
<p>Gambling disorder is not as common as other substance abuse disorders, but it does affect some people severely. The National Council on Problem Gambling estimates that about 2% of Americans have a severe form of problem gambling called “pathological gambler”. Another 3% have moderate problem gambling behaviors. And another 5% have mild problems with gambling behavior. So while it’s not as common as other addictions, it still affects a sizable number of people.</p>
<h1 id="Removing-gambling-disorder-from-the-list-of-impulse-control-disorders-could-lead-to-more-people-seeking-treatment"><a href="#Removing-gambling-disorder-from-the-list-of-impulse-control-disorders-could-lead-to-more-people-seeking-treatment" class="headerlink" title="Removing gambling disorder from the list of impulse control disorders could lead to more people seeking treatment"></a>Removing gambling disorder from the list of impulse control disorders could lead to more people seeking treatment</h1><p>Removing gambling disorder from the list of impulse control disorders could lead to more people seeking treatment for the disorder, according to a study published in the journal <i>Addictive Behaviors</i>.</p>
<p>The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Buffalo, looked at data from nearly 3,000 adults who had been diagnosed with gambling disorder. The findings showed that only 36 percent of those individuals received treatment for their disorder.</p>
<p>The results suggest that removing gambling disorder from the list of impulse control disorders could lead to more people seeking treatment for the disorder. This is important, given that gambling disorder can be a serious and debilitating condition.</p>
<p>According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA), gambling disorder is “a complex mental health condition that can be difficult to diagnose.” The condition is characterized by a persistent and problematic urge to gamble, even when it leads to negative consequences.</p>
<p>Gambling disorder can have a devastating impact on sufferers and their families. It can cause financial problems, relationships breakdowns, and even suicide.</p>
<p>Given the seriousness of gambling disorder, it is important that as many people as possible receive treatment for the condition. Removing gambling disorder from the list of impulse control disorders could be one way of achieving this goal.</p>

        <h1 id="Study-Shows-Tennessee-Collects-Over-50-Million-in-Online-Gambling-Revenue-Annually"><a href="#Study-Shows-Tennessee-Collects-Over-50-Million-in-Online-Gambling-Revenue-Annually" class="headerlink" title="Study Shows Tennessee Collects Over $50 Million in Online Gambling Revenue Annually"></a>Study Shows Tennessee Collects Over $50 Million in Online Gambling Revenue Annually</h1><p>A new study has shown that Tennessee is one of the leading states in the country when it comes to online gambling revenue. The study, which was conducted by the University of Nevada, Reno, found that Tennessee collected over $50 million in online gambling revenue in 2017.</p>
<p>This figure ranks Tennessee as the sixth-highest state in the nation for online gambling revenue. It also accounts for over 2% of the state’s annual budget.</p>
<p>The study found that most of Tennessee’s online gambling revenue came from internet casino games. This was followed by online poker and then sports betting.</p>
<p>Revenue from online gambling is projected to continue rising in Tennessee. In 2018, the state is expected to generate over $60 million in online gambling revenue. This would rank Tennessee as the fourth-highest state in the nation for online gambling revenue.</p>
<p>Online gambling is currently illegal in Tennessee. However, lawmakers are considering legalizing and regulating the industry in order to generate additional tax revenue.</p>
<h1 id="Tennessee-Revenue-from-Online-Gambling-Soars-in-Recent-Years"><a href="#Tennessee-Revenue-from-Online-Gambling-Soars-in-Recent-Years" class="headerlink" title="Tennessee Revenue from Online Gambling Soars in Recent Years"></a>Tennessee Revenue from Online Gambling Soars in Recent Years</h1><p>In the state of Tennessee, online gambling revenue has been on the rise in recent years. According to data from the Tennessee Department of Revenue, online gambling revenue totaled $9.7 million in 2017, up from $1.8 million in 2013. This surge in revenue is likely due to the increasing popularity of online gambling, as well as the growing trend of states legalizing and regulating such activities. In 2017, Tennessee became one of several states to legalize and regulate online sports betting, which is likely contributing to the rising revenue from online gambling.</p>
<p>Interestingly, much of the online gambling revenue in Tennessee comes from out-of-state players. In 2017, non-residents accounted for $8.5 million of the $9.7 million in total online gambling revenue in Tennessee. This suggests that Tennessee’s regulated online gambling market is attracting players from other states, which is a positive development for the industry overall.</p>
<p>The rise in online gambling revenue in Tennessee is a positive sign for the industry as a whole. With more states legalizing and regulating online gambling activities, this will create a larger and more stable market for operators. Additionally, the increase in tax revenue generated by online gambling will be beneficial for states looking to boost their budgets.</p>
<h1 id="Online-Gambling-Brings-in-Over-5-Million-to-Tennessee-Taxpayers-Every-Month"><a href="#Online-Gambling-Brings-in-Over-5-Million-to-Tennessee-Taxpayers-Every-Month" class="headerlink" title="Online Gambling Brings in Over $5 Million to Tennessee Taxpayers Every Month"></a>Online Gambling Brings in Over $5 Million to Tennessee Taxpayers Every Month</h1><p>When Tennessee legalized online gambling in 2016, it was expected that the tax revenue generated from it would be in the millions. But no one could have predicted just how successful the industry would be.</p>
<p>In the first year of operation, online gambling brought in over $5 million in tax revenue for the state of Tennessee! That’s an average of $416,667 per month – more than enough to cover the costs associated with regulating and taxing the industry.</p>
<p>Not only is online gambling a major contributor to the state’s coffers, but it has also created hundreds of jobs in Tennessee. In fact, the industry is now worth over $100 million and is growing rapidly.</p>
<p>So why is online gambling so popular in Tennessee? There are a few reasons.</p>
<p>For starters, there’s convenience. Gamblers can access their favorite casino games from anywhere in the state, using any device they choose. And because online casinos are heavily regulated by the state government, players can be sure that they are getting a fair game.</p>
<p>Another reason for online gambling’s popularity is its variety. Players can choose from a wide range of games, including slots, blackjack, roulette, and poker. There are also many different betting options available, so players can find a game that suits their budget.</p>
<p>And finally, there’s value. Online casinos often offer better odds and bigger jackpots than their land-based counterparts. This means that players have a much better chance of winning big money!</p>
<h1 id="Is-Online-Gambling-Hurting-the-State-of-Tennessee"><a href="#Is-Online-Gambling-Hurting-the-State-of-Tennessee" class="headerlink" title="Is Online Gambling Hurting the State of Tennessee?"></a>Is Online Gambling Hurting the State of Tennessee?</h1><p>The legalization of gambling has been a topic of hot debate for many years. There are those who argue that it should be legalized because it is a form of entertainment, and there are those who argue that it should not be legalized because it can lead to addiction and other social problems. The states that have legalized gambling have seen mixed results. Some see an increase in tax revenue, while others see an increase in crime rates and social problems.</p>
<p>One state that is currently seeing the negative effects of gambling is Tennessee. In 2006, the state legalized casino gambling in an attempt to bring more money into the government coffers. However, the state has not seen the increase in tax revenue that was expected. In fact, the state has actually seen a decrease in tax revenue since the casinos were opened. This is likely due to the fact that many people who would have normally spent their money in Tennessee casinos are now spending it in neighbouring states where gambling is legal.</p>
<p>This is having a negative effect on the local economy. In addition, there has been an increase in crime rates and social problems since the casinos were opened. This is likely due to the fact that many people who are addicted to gambling are now traveling to Tennessee to gamble. The state has already spent millions of dollars on law enforcement and social services to deal with the negative effects of gambling, and it is likely that these costs will continue to rise in the future.</p>
<p>It is clear that gambling has had a negative effect on Tennessee. The state should repeal its laws legalizing casino gambling and focus on other forms of revenue generation.</p>
<h1 id="Study-Tennessee-Could-be-Missing-Out-on-Millions-in-Revenue-from-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Study-Tennessee-Could-be-Missing-Out-on-Millions-in-Revenue-from-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Study: Tennessee Could be Missing Out on Millions in Revenue from Online Gambling"></a>Study: Tennessee Could be Missing Out on Millions in Revenue from Online Gambling</h1><p>While other states are legalizing and profiting from online gambling, a recent study of Tennessee finds the state could be missing out on millions in revenue.</p>
<p>Commissioned by the American Gaming Association (AGA), the study found that Tennessee could earn up to $183 million annually in tax revenue by legalizing and regulating online gambling. The study also found that Tennessee could create nearly 2,000 jobs if online gambling were legalized.</p>
<p>“This study confirms what we have long believed – that online gambling is a major opportunity for states like Tennessee to generate new revenue, create jobs and support local businesses,” said Geoff Freeman, president and CEO of the AGA.</p>
<p>Freeman noted that while other states are already benefiting from online gambling, Tennessee is losing out on potential revenue. Eleven states have already legalized some form of online gambling, including Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware.</p>
<p>Opposition to Online Gambling in Tennessee</p>
<p>Despite the potential benefits, there is strong opposition to legalizing online gambling in Tennessee. State Senator Bill Ketron has been a vocal opponent of online gambling and has introduced legislation to ban it in the state.</p>
<p>In a statement released by Ketron, he argued that online gambling is a “dangerous addiction” that can lead to financial ruin for many people. “This isn’t about generating new revenue for the state; it’s about exploiting vulnerable people for profit,” said Ketron.</p>
<p>Critics of Ketron’s position argue that he is simply trying to protect the interests of casino owners in the state who would stand to lose profits if online gambling was legalized. Casino owners have contributed heavily to Ketron’s political campaigns in the past.</p>
<p>The Future of Online Gambling in Tennessee</p>
<p>Despite the opposition, there is growing momentum behind efforts to legalize online gambling in Tennessee. A recent poll conducted by Vanderbilt University found that 59 percent of Tennesseans supported legalizing and regulating online gambling.</p>
<p>Governor Bill Haslam has also signaled his support for studying the issue further. In a statement released last year, Haslam said that he was open to exploring the possibility of legalizing online gaming “if it can be demonstrated that it would be good for our state economically and result in additional tax revenues.”</p>

While casinos may be the more stereotypical example of a gambling den, sports betting and online casinos are also prime examples. Gambling addiction is a serious problem that ruins the lives of many people. In this article, we will explore how gambling dens enable gambling addicts to ruin their lives.</p>
<p>The first way in which gambling dens enable gambling addicts to ruin their lives is by providing an environment in which they can engage in habitual gambling. This means that they can go to the casino or place a bet online whenever they want, without having to worry about anyone judging them. This type of environment can be very dangerous for those with a gambling addiction, as it can lead to them spending more money than they can afford and eventually losing everything they have.</p>
<p>Another way in which gambling dens enable gambling addicts to ruin their lives is by providing them with easy access to credit. This means that if they run out of money while gambling, they can easily borrow more from the casino or bookmaker. This type of credit can be very dangerous for those with a gambling addiction, as it can lead to them borrowing more and more money until they eventually lose everything.</p>
<p>Gambling dens also enable gambling addicts to ruin their lives by providing them with an escape from their problems. This means that if they are feeling stressed or unhappy, they can go to the casino or online casino and gamble themselves into a better mood. While this may seem like a harmless thing, it can actually be very dangerous for those with a gambling addiction, as it can lead to them spending more time and money on gambling than they should be doing.</p>
<p>Ultimately, gambling dens enable gambling addicts to ruin their lives by providing them with an easy way to access addictive substances and by providing them with an escape from their problems. This makes it very dangerous for those with a gambling addiction, as it can lead to them losing everything they have worked for. If you know someone who has a problem with gambling, then urge them to seek help before it is too late.</p>
<h1 id="How-Gambling-Dens-Can-Enable-More-Problem-Gambling"><a href="#How-Gambling-Dens-Can-Enable-More-Problem-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="How Gambling Dens Can Enable More Problem Gambling"></a>How Gambling Dens Can Enable More Problem Gambling</h1><p>Problem gambling, also commonly referred to as compulsive gambling and pathological gambling, is a mental health disorder where individuals experience frequent and uncontrollable urges to gamble. Problem gambling can have devastating consequences for both the individual and their loved ones, including job loss, financial instability, and strained relationships.</p>
<p>It is estimated that between two and six percent of the adult population in the United States suffers from problem gambling, making it one of the most common addictions in the country. While anyone can develop a problem with gambling, some groups are at a higher risk than others. Those who live in poverty or in deprived areas are more likely to gamble, as are those who have struggled with other addictions such as alcohol or drugs.</p>
<p>There are a number of interventions that can be used to treat problem gambling, including cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), medications, and self-help groups. However, there is no one-size-fits-all approach and what works for one person may not work for another. Some people may need to attend residential treatment programs while others may be able to recover with the help of outpatient therapy and support from family and friends.</p>
<p>Despite the availability of treatment options, only a small proportion of people with problem gambling seek help. This may be due in part to the social stigma associated with addiction disorders. Gambling dens can play a role in exacerbating problem gambling by normalizing and glamorizing casino-style gaming. They can also provide easy access to gambling activities, which can increase the risk of developing a problem.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know is struggling with problem gambling, it is important to seek help. There are many resources available, including professionals who specialize in treating this condition. With treatment, most people are able to overcome their addiction and resume healthy lives.</p>
<h1 id="Gambling-dens-enable-addicts-to-lose-more-money"><a href="#Gambling-dens-enable-addicts-to-lose-more-money" class="headerlink" title="Gambling dens enable addicts to lose more money"></a>Gambling dens enable addicts to lose more money</h1><p>Problem gambling is a significant social and public health problem. The widespread availability of licensed gambling venues enables addicts to lose more money and suffer greater personal and social harms.</p>
<p>Problem gambling is a form of addiction that leads people to lose control over their spending on gambling activities. This can cause significant problems for the individual, such as damage to personal relationships, employment and financial difficulties.</p>
<p>The availability of licensed gambling venues, such as casinos, poker machines and race tracks, enables addicts to lose more money more quickly and suffer greater personal and social harms. Venues are often conveniently located near major population centres, making them easily accessible.</p>
<p>Addicts can quickly lose large sums of money in a short period of time, leading to financial ruin. Gambling also has negative consequences for family members and friends, who can often be left to pick up the pieces.</p>
<p>Problem gambling is a serious social issue that requires government intervention. The widespread availability of licensed gambling venues needs to be addressed if we are to reduce the harm caused by problem gambling.</p>
<h1 id="How-gambling-dens-can-be-a-breeding-ground-for-problem-gambling"><a href="#How-gambling-dens-can-be-a-breeding-ground-for-problem-gambling" class="headerlink" title="How gambling dens can be a breeding ground for problem gambling"></a>How gambling dens can be a breeding ground for problem gambling</h1><p>Problem gambling is a major public health concern that can have a devastating impact on the lives of those affected. Gambling dens represent one possible environment where problem gambling can flourish. In this article, we will explore the ways in which gambling dens can be a breeding ground for problem gambling and discuss some of the steps that can be taken to address this issue.</p>
<p>Gambling dens are places where people can go to gamble with real money. They can be found in casinos, racetracks, and other locations around the world. While there is nothing wrong with gambling in itself, problem gambling can become a serious issue when it starts to affect someone’s life in a negative way.</p>
<p>There are many factors that can contribute to problem gambling, and one of these is the environment in which it takes place. The availability of gambling opportunities and the intense atmosphere of casino gaming can be a potent mix for those who are susceptible to developing a problem with gambling. This is particularly true for those who are already struggling with other issues such as mental health problems or addiction.</p>
<p>Gambling dens can also be dangerous places for those who struggle with addiction. Casino gaming is an activity that involves high levels of risk, and it can be very easy for someone who is addicted to gambling to lose control and spiral out of control. Addicted gamblers may also be preyed on by loan sharks or other unscrupulous characters who are looking to take advantage of them financially.</p>
<p>In light of these risks, it is important that measures are put in place to protect those who are vulnerable to developing a problem with gambling. This includes providing access to support services and education programmes that can help people stay safe while enjoying legal forms of gambling. It is also important to create a safe and responsible environment in which people can gamble without feeling like they are under pressure to risk more than they can afford to lose.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is up to each individual gambler to take responsibility for their own behaviour while enjoying legal forms of gambling. However, society also has a role to play in creating an environment where responsible gambling is encouraged and problem gambling is addressed head-on.”</p>
<h1 id="How-casinos-enable-gambling-addicts-to-keep-gambling"><a href="#How-casinos-enable-gambling-addicts-to-keep-gambling" class="headerlink" title="How casinos enable gambling addicts to keep gambling"></a>How casinos enable gambling addicts to keep gambling</h1><p>When it comes to casinos, there’s no doubt that they’re a great place to have fun and potentially make some money. However, for some people, casinos can be a dangerous place that enables gambling addiction. In this article, we’re going to take a look at how casinos enable gambling addicts to keep gambling and the measures that should be put in place to help these people.</p>
<p>One of the main ways in which casinos enable gambling addiction is through the availability of credit. Most casinos will allow players to borrow money in order to continue playing and, for some people, this can be very dangerous. It can be very easy for someone with a gambling addiction to get caught up in the cycle of borrowing more and more money in order to keep playing. This can quickly lead to financial disaster and serious debt problems.</p>
<p>Another way in which casinos enable gambling addiction is through their design. Casinos are often brightly lit and noisy, which can make it difficult for people with a gambling addiction to resist temptation. The constant sound of gaming machines and jackpot announcements can be overwhelming and addictive for some people. In addition, the layout of casinos often promotes gambling. For example, many casinos have large areas where players can bet on table games or sports matches. This type of environment is perfect for someone with a gambling addiction as it encourages them to gamble more and lose more money.</p>
<p>It is clear that casinos play a significant role in enabling gambling addiction and this needs to change. There are several measures that could be put in place to help reduce the number of people who become addicted due to casino activities. Firstly, credit should not be available at casinos as this can lead people into serious debt problems. Secondly, the design of casinos should be changed so that they are not so bright and noisy. This would make it easier for people with a gambling addiction to resist temptation. Finally, the layout of casinos should be changed so that there are less opportunities to gamble on table games or sports matches. This would prevent people from losing too much money in one go.</p>
<p>So, next time you visit your local casino, think about how it might be enabling someone’s gambling addiction. Be sure to take measures yourself such as not using credit cards and avoiding areas where you’re likely to spend more money than you intended!</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="Maryland-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Maryland-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Maryland to Legalize Online Gambling"></a>Maryland to Legalize Online Gambling</h1><p>The state of Maryland is in the process of legalizing online gambling, with a bill that was recently introduced in the Senate. The legislation would allow both casino and lottery games to be offered online, with the hope of boosting revenue for the state.</p>
<p>Maryland is not the only state looking into legalizing online gambling - several others have introduced or are considering bills, including Indiana, Louisiana and Pennsylvania. This is in response to the growing popularity of online gaming, as well as increasing pressure from casino interests who see this as a potential new market.</p>
<p>Opponents of online gambling argue that it can be addictive and lead to financial problems for players. They also point to cases where gamblers have stolen money from friends or family in order to feed their addiction.</p>
<p>Supporters of legalization argue that these risks already exist with traditional gambling, and that properly regulating online gaming can help minimize them. They also say that it can be a valuable source of revenue for states, which are struggling with budget deficits.</p>
<p>So far, there does not appear to be much public opposition to Maryland’s proposal, and it is likely to pass given the current political climate. If it does, it will join a handful of states that offer legalized online gambling.</p>
<h1 id="Delaware-Authorizes-First-Online-Casino"><a href="#Delaware-Authorizes-First-Online-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Delaware Authorizes First Online Casino"></a>Delaware Authorizes First Online Casino</h1><p>The state of Delaware has authorized the first online casino in the country. The new casino will be an extension of the three brick-and-mortar casinos that are already operating in the state. The new online casino is expected to be up and running in early 2013.</p>
<p>Delaware is one of only three states in the country that currently allows gambling. In addition to the new online casino, Delaware also offers betting on horse races and lottery games.</p>
<p>The online casino will be operated by Scientific Games Corporation, which already operates the state’s three brick-and-mortar casinos. The company was awarded a 20-year contract to operate the new casino.</p>
<p>The new casino will offer a variety of games, including slots, blackjack, and roulette. It will also offer a number of different betting options, including single bets, multi-game bets, and progressive jackpots.</p>
<p>Delaware officials believe that the new casino will be a major boon to the state’s economy. Chris Grundler, director of marketing for the Delaware Lottery, said that the online casino “will create jobs and generate revenue for Delaware through licensing fees and taxes.”</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-Authorizes-Second-Online-Casino"><a href="#Nevada-Authorizes-Second-Online-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Nevada Authorizes Second Online Casino"></a>Nevada Authorizes Second Online Casino</h1><p>The Nevada Gaming Commission has unanimously approved the issuance of a state gaming license to an online casino owned and operated by the Las Vegas Sands Corporation. This is the second online casino to be authorized in Nevada, following the approval of an online casino operated by the Wynn Resorts Corporation in February of this year.</p>
<p>The Sands online casino will offer a full range of gaming options, including blackjack, roulette, and slots. It will also offer a variety of promotions and bonuses, including a first-time deposit bonus of $300 for new players.</p>
<p>The approval of the Sands casino marks another step forward for the legalisation of online gambling in the United States. Several other states are currently considering proposals to legalize online gambling, including California, New York, and Illinois.</p>
<h1 id="Pennsylvania-Passes-Law-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling"><a href="#Pennsylvania-Passes-Law-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Pennsylvania Passes Law to Legalize Online Gambling"></a>Pennsylvania Passes Law to Legalize Online Gambling</h1><p>In what can be seen as a watershed moment for the gambling industry, on October 30th, Pennsylvania became the fourth state in the US to legalize online gambling. The law allows licensed casinos in the state to offer casino games and poker over the internet.</p>
<p>Industry experts have been predicting the legalization of online gambling for some time now, as states look for new ways to generate revenue and tap into an increasingly popular market. Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware were the first states to legalize online gambling in 2013, with Pennsylvania following suit four years later.</p>
<p>Opposition to online gambling has been muted, with many people arguing that it is a safer option than traditional forms of gambling like casino and sports betting. The new law in Pennsylvania also includes measures to protect players from problem gambling, such as a ban on sports betting and limits on how much people can spend on online gambling each week.</p>
<p>The passage of this law is likely to be good news for casino operators in Pennsylvania, who are facing increased competition from neighbouring states. Online gambling is expected to generate $204 million in revenue for casinos in Pennsylvania in its first year of operation, according to estimates by Moody’s.</p>
<p>The trend towards legalizing online gambling is likely to continue, as more states look for ways to increase their revenues without raising taxes. This is good news for consumers too, who will have access to a wider range of legal options when it comes to gambling.</p>
<h1 id="New-York-May-Be-Next-State-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling"><a href="#New-York-May-Be-Next-State-to-Legalize-Online-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="New York May Be Next State to Legalize Online Gambling"></a>New York May Be Next State to Legalize Online Gambling</h1><p>For years, the online gambling industry has operated in a legal gray area. While some states have chosen to legalize and regulate the activity, others have taken a more prohibition-based approach. But this balance may be about to change, as New York looks poised to become the next state to legalize online gambling.</p>
<p>The impetus for this change appears to be financial. New York is facing a budget shortfall of up to $4 billion, and online gambling could provide a much-needed revenue stream. In addition, there is evidence that legalization could create jobs and bring in new tourism dollars.</p>
<p>Legalization would also allow New York’s existing brick-and-mortar casinos to expand into the online marketplace. This would give them a competitive edge over casinos in other states, which are not currently able to offer online gambling.</p>
<p>So far, there has been no official announcement from the governor’s office regarding plans to legalize online gambling. But there is considerable momentum behind the effort, and it seems likely that something will happen in the near future.</p>

<h1 id="When-to-Split-in-Blackjack-at-Casino-Rancho"><a href="#When-to-Split-in-Blackjack-at-Casino-Rancho" class="headerlink" title="When to Split in Blackjack at Casino Rancho"></a>When to Split in Blackjack at Casino Rancho</h1><p>There are a number of conflicting rules out there about when to split in blackjack at Casino Rancho. You may have heard that you should always split a pair of aces, for example. But is that really the best strategy?</p>
<p>To answer this question, it’s important to understand the basic rules of blackjack. In blackjack, the aim is to beat the dealer by getting closer to 21 than he does, without going over. If you get 21 immediately (a “blackjack”), you automatically win!</p>
<p>In general, you should always split a pair of 8s, 10s, and aces. For other pairs, it depends on the composition of the dealer’s hand. For example, if the dealer has an ace as his upcard, you should not split any pairs except 2s.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that when the dealer has an ace as his upcard, he has a good chance of getting close to 21 (the ace can be counted as 1 or 11). Therefore, splitting your low cards (2s through 7s) would be a bad move, because the odds are high that both cards will get busted.</p>
<p>If the dealer has a 2 as his upcard, on the other hand, you should always split a pair of 2s. This is because when the dealer has a low card as his upcard, he is more likely to bust. So by splitting your 2s, you have better odds of winning one hand and losing another instead of both hands getting busted.</p>

        <h1 id="If-The-Sportsbook-Is-Coming-To-Be-Able-To-Rivers-Casino-In-Illinois-It’ll-Have-Plenty-Of-Competition"><a href="#If-The-Sportsbook-Is-Coming-To-Be-Able-To-Rivers-Casino-In-Illinois-It’ll-Have-Plenty-Of-Competition" class="headerlink" title="If The Sportsbook Is Coming To Be Able To Rivers Casino In Illinois, It’ll Have Plenty Of Competition"></a>If The Sportsbook Is Coming To Be Able To Rivers Casino In Illinois, It’ll Have Plenty Of Competition</h1><p>Rivers Casino in Des Plaines, Illinois, is one of the most successful casinos in the state. It’s been so successful that its owner, Neil Bluhm, has ambitions to expand it by building a sportsbook.</p>
<p>Adding a sportsbook would give Rivers Casino a competitive edge over other casinos in the area, but it won’t be easy. The Illinois Gaming Board is expected to approve at least one other sportsbook license this year, and there are already a few casinos in the state that offer sports betting.</p>
<p>If Rivers Casino does get a sportsbook license, it’ll have to compete with several large casinos that are also located near Chicago. These casinos include Hollywood Casino Aurora,entertainment- focused Harrah’s Joliet Hotel Casino, and the Grand Victoria Casino in Elgin.</p>
<p>Each of these casinos has something that Rivers Casino likely doesn’t: a hotel. This could give them an advantage when it comes to attracting customers who want to stay overnight.</p>
<p>Rivers Casino may also have trouble competing with casinos that are located closer to the city of Chicago. These casinos include the recently opened Sterling Gaming casino and the soon-to-open casino from Majestic Star Holdings LLC.</p>
<p>The competition for a sportsbook license in Illinois is going to be fierce, but Rivers Casino is well-funded and has a lot to offer potential customers. If it can find a way to standout from the competition, it could be very successful.</p>
<h1 id="If-The-Sportsbook-Is-Coming-To-Be-Able-To-Rivers-Casino-In-Illinois-It-Had-Better-Offer-Good-Odds"><a href="#If-The-Sportsbook-Is-Coming-To-Be-Able-To-Rivers-Casino-In-Illinois-It-Had-Better-Offer-Good-Odds" class="headerlink" title="If The Sportsbook Is Coming To Be Able To Rivers Casino In Illinois, It Had Better Offer Good Odds"></a>If The Sportsbook Is Coming To Be Able To Rivers Casino In Illinois, It Had Better Offer Good Odds</h1><p>Casinos have been popping up all over the United States in recent years, as more states legalize gambling. The latest trend in the casino industry is sports betting, and now there’s a move afoot to bring a sportsbook to the Rivers Casino in Illinois.</p>
<p>If the Rivers Casino does add a sportsbook, it had better offer good odds if it wants to attract business from gamblers. The last thing casino operators want is to offer lousy odds and drive customers to their competitors.</p>
<p>Fortunately for the Rivers Casino, there are plenty of established sportsbooks that would be willing to partner with it if it decides to enter the sports betting market. These sportsbooks have years of experience in setting lines and paying out winners.</p>
<p>One downside for the Rivers Casino, though, is that it will likely have to pay a significant licensing fee to a partner sportsbook. This could amount to millions of dollars per year.</p>
<p>In order to make up for this expense, the Rivers Casino would need to generate a large amount of betting volume. This is not impossible, but it will be challenging considering that there are already well-established sportsbooks in Chicago and throughout Illinois.</p>
<p>If the Rivers Casino can overcome these challenges, it could be in for a profitable venture with its new sportsbook.</p>
<h1 id="Rivers-Casino-Could-Soon-Add-A-Sportsbook-If-Illinois-Legalizes-Gambling"><a href="#Rivers-Casino-Could-Soon-Add-A-Sportsbook-If-Illinois-Legalizes-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Rivers Casino Could Soon Add A Sportsbook If Illinois Legalizes Gambling"></a>Rivers Casino Could Soon Add A Sportsbook If Illinois Legalizes Gambling</h1><p>Casino executives told the Chicago Sun-Times that they could add a sportsbook if Illinois legalizes gambling.</p>
<p>Rivers Casino is looking to install a new sports betting lounge at its Des Plaines property, pending the legalization of sports gambling in Illinois.</p>
<p>“We would hope that it’s something that would be passed sooner than later,” said Greg Carlin, CEO of Rush Street Gaming, which owns Rivers Casino. “We are certainly looking at designs and layouts for a new lounge area.”</p>
<p>Illinois lawmakers have been considering legalizing sports gambling for months, but no action has been taken yet.</p>
<p>Several other casino companies are also lobbying for legislation to legalize sports betting in Illinois, including Harrah’s Joliet, Hollywood Casino Aurora and Prairie State Gaming.</p>
<p>If legalized, sports betting would likely generate millions of dollars in tax revenue for the state.</p>
<h1 id="Illinois-May-Finally-Legalize-Gambling-Which-Could-Mean-A-Sportsbook-At-Rivers-Casino"><a href="#Illinois-May-Finally-Legalize-Gambling-Which-Could-Mean-A-Sportsbook-At-Rivers-Casino" class="headerlink" title="Illinois May Finally Legalize Gambling, Which Could Mean A Sportsbook At Rivers Casino"></a>Illinois May Finally Legalize Gambling, Which Could Mean A Sportsbook At Rivers Casino</h1><p>Illinois lawmakers have signaled they will legalize gambling in the state before the end of the year, which could result in a Rivers Casino sportsbook.</p>
<p>Casino magnate Sheldon Adelson has pledged to spend $150 million to help legalize gambling in Illinois, and it seems he may have finally found a state willing to take his money.</p>
<p>The legalization of gambling in Illinois was first proposed back in February, and it looks like things are moving ahead quickly. According to reports, lawmakers are close to hammering out a deal that would see casino gambling legalized in the state.</p>
<p>If a deal is reached, it’s likely that Sheldon Adelson and his company, Las Vegas Sands, will be one of the biggest beneficiaries. Adelson has been pushing for the legalization of gambling for some time now, and he stands to make a lot of money if it goes through.</p>
<p>The legalization of gambling in Illinois would be a huge win for Adelson, as the state is home to over 12 million people. That’s significantly more than Nevada, which is home to just 3 million people.</p>
<p>Adelson has been spending big money in order to get his casino interests legalized in various states across the US. He’s already had some success, with casinos opening up in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts.</p>
<p>If Illinois does legalize gambling, it’s likely that Rivers Casino will get approval for a sportsbook. The casino is already licensed to offer sports betting, but it’s been waiting for lawmakers to give them the green light.</p>
<p>Rivers Casino is one of the most profitable casinos in the US, so it would make sense for them to get into the sports betting market. The casino has already partnered with Churchill Downs Inc., so they’re ready and waiting if legalization does go ahead.</p>
<h1 id="Is-The-Rivers-Casino-In-Illinois-Getting-A-Sportsbook-Depends-On-If-Gambling-Gets-Legalized"><a href="#Is-The-Rivers-Casino-In-Illinois-Getting-A-Sportsbook-Depends-On-If-Gambling-Gets-Legalized" class="headerlink" title="Is The Rivers Casino In Illinois Getting A Sportsbook? Depends On If Gambling Gets Legalized"></a>Is The Rivers Casino In Illinois Getting A Sportsbook? Depends On If Gambling Gets Legalized</h1><p>There’s been a lot of speculation in the last few months that the Rivers Casino in Des Plaines, Illinois may well be getting a sportsbook. The talk intensified recently when representatives of the casino made a presentation to the state gambling board in which they asked for permission to offer sports betting.</p>
<p>It’s no secret that casinos are looking to get into sports betting as a way to bring in more revenue, and the Rivers Casino is no exception. So far, however, no decision has been made on whether or not to legalize gambling in Illinois, which would include sports betting.</p>
<p>If gambling is legalized in Illinois, it’s likely that the Rivers Casino will get a sportsbook. There are already plans in the works for a new facility that would include a sportsbook, as well as other amenities like restaurants and shops.</p>
<p>The Rivers Casino isn’t alone in wanting to offer sports betting if it becomes legal in Illinois. Recently, Caesars Entertainment Corporation also applied for a license to offer sports betting in the state.</p>
<p>It’s unclear at this point whether or not gambling will be legalized in Illinois, but if it is, it looks like the Rivers Casino will be one of the first places where you can place a bet on your favorite team.</p>

North American casinos make more than 80% of their slot machine revenue from penny and nickel slots. These games are typically tight, meaning the house edge is high, as players hope to hit a jackpot that will cover their losses.</p>
<p>Table games account for about 25% of casino gaming revenue, with blackjack the most popular game. In most cases, the house edge on blackjack is less than 1%, making it one of the best bets in the casino. Craps is another popular table game, with a house edge of around 1.4%. Roulette has a house edge of about 2.7%.</p>
<p>Baccarat is a high stakes game played by wealthy players. The house edge is about 1.06%, making it one of the most favorable games in the casino. Sports betting accounts for only a tiny fraction of casino revenues, but it is growing rapidly as more states legalize sports betting.</p>
